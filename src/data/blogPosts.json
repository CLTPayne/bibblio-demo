    "post_content": "<p><span>With so much negative coverage of publishing, we at Bibblio are shining a spotlight on the many vertical publishers that are thriving. Welcome to the \"Vertical Heroes\" series of interviews.</span></p> <!--more--> <p><span>In this seventh edition, <a href=\"https://www.psfk.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PSFK</a> founder, president &amp; editor-in-chief Piers Fawkes unveils how his B2B company helps</span><span> brands and retailers build tomorrow's customer experiences. </span><span>Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen had a chat with Piers about being service-minded as a publication, their spin-off event this January and developing their paywall solution <a href=\"https://wallkit.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wallkit</a> that they're offering to others.</span></p> <p><strong>Mads:&nbsp;Who is your PSFK's target audience?</strong></p> <p>Piers: Our focus is to serve innovation and consumer insights executives who work in retail, at brands – and strategists and planners at agencies. We see three distinct user types – which can relate to their seniority (but not always):</p> <ol> <li>An innovation lead, who's a problem solver within an organization – and typically called upon to be an idea presenter and generator.</li> <li>A manager, who identifies opportunities for their organization. They are a cross-function communicator and project coordinator.</li> <li>A director, who are internal growth catalysts. They tend to be multi-disciplined leaders and are subject matter experts.</li> </ol> <p><strong>M: What different types of content are you offering these retail and brand professionals?</strong></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-piers-fawkes.jpg\" alt=\"Piers Fawkes, founder, president &amp; editor-in-chief of PSFK\"> <figcaption>Piers Fawkes, founder, president &amp; editor-in-chief of PSFK</figcaption> </figure> <p><span>P: We think about how we serve those three user types in similar but differing ways. Overall we look to provide daily research on market trends, consumer insights and competitive activity through newsletters and our site. We provide tools on-site to help manage knowledge resources and synthesize findings into solutions and research reports. The reports are our most sought-after content and we prioritize our SEO efforts to this content type.</span></p> <p><span>We also present strategic recommendations through webinars and events. We offer paid research presentations of existing research and professionally facilitated, multi-day workshops through our PSFK Labs division. We also take corporate teams on 'trends safaris', putting them face-to-face with retail innovation in the marketplace.</span></p> <p><strong>M: How large is PSFK in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p><span>P: We have </span><span>200,000 monthly readers and 25,000 newsletter subscribers. We publish about 30 times a day in different formats. Most our daily content staff are contributors. Full time staff on editorial is just two people. The research and report writing team are 25.</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: You've managed to grow your revenue impressively. What has been the secret sauce?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>P: </span><span>We probably don’t look like we grew on paper – but financially we did once we added the Wallkit paywall. Then we focused on the few folks who literally bought into us for our bespoke and strategic services. It's a low 5 figures for a 10-person team to be members and have access to reports and our researchers.</span></p> <p><span>We focus on trying to understand what our role is in our reader, subscriber and member’s day to day. We help them identify and evaluate new opportunities. We also help them formulate actionable recommendations, present and communicate strategies, and understand innovations and evolving industries.</span></p> <p><strong>M: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?</strong></p> <p>P: <span>The joy of charging for content means that we can focus on creating great content rather than make advertisers and sponsors happy. If you make just enough of that great content available for everyone – and for us, this is mainly through the free newsletters – it brings in a stream of new folks into our pipeline.</span></p> <p><strong>M: How are you retaining these subscribers beyond creating content?</strong></p> <p><span>P: Firstly, we focus on the retention of our highest paying audiences. The Wallkit membership system helps us segment our audience and user type, and then create triggers to engage folks who are coming up for renewal. </span><span>We do have to make sure that not all correspondence is automated though. The personal touch is a significant factor in our success.</span></p> <p><strong>M: What's the key audience metrics you define success by?</strong></p> <p>P:&nbsp; Our goal is to reach a m<span>embership &amp; subscription growth of 25% on last year’s numbers. It's $15 a month for an individual to subscribe to all our content. We track all this through Wallkit.</span></p> <p><strong>M: What's PSFK's social media strategy?</strong></p> <p>P:&nbsp;<span>As we’re a B2B publication, it’s LinkedIn mainly. The professional social platform is a bit of a stodgy beast, but here are some new ways to present ideas developing in this space which we’re exploring. It's worth checking out what Gary Vaynerchuck is doing with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6549761026693312512/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">multiple images</a>.</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M:&nbsp; How do you drive engagement when readers land on your site? </strong></p> <p><span>P: Wallkit changes the content shown based on the subscriber or member level – or whether you’re a stranger. We can therefore funnel newbies to rich, evergreen content and we can provide our highest paying members with content that fits their needs and previous behavior.</span></p> <p><strong>M: Are you working together with other publications for retail and brands?</strong></p> <p>P:&nbsp; <span>We’d love to do that. It'd be amazing to have our readers be able to look at content on other publishers’ sites and vice versa. Again, Wallkit allows this gate-crashing to happen with rules in place to help both publishers. </span></p> <p><span>I’ve started to reach out to folks in my space to make this happen – and if there’s anyone reading who wants to be part of this, let me know.</span></p> <p><strong>M: What's the area you're most excited about?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><span>P: We are building a spin off called New York Retail Innovation Week – it’s part calendar, part in-convention, part content program. Events are interesting as long as you can find a way of delivering them without doing all the work. Check out <a href=\"http://riw.nyc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NYRIW</a> if you want to learn more.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nyriw-home.jpg\" alt=\"NY Retail Innovation Week home page\"> <figcaption>NY Retail Innovation Week home page</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: From your own journey, what do think other vertical publishers could learn?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>P: <span>I see PSFK as a service. We try to approach our UX as software. It doesn’t always come out that way because the legacy of publishing (and doing what publishers are “supposed” to do). This means we have a lot of muscle memory to overcome. The key motto at PSFK is relentless iteration.</span></p> <p><strong>M: Can you share some interesting stats on launching a subscription model?</strong></p> <p><span>P: Yes. Installing a paywall will reduce your traffic by about 95%. And of the people who will continue to interact with you, </span><span>95% will not pay you directly for subscription.</span></p> <p><strong>M: Which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p><span>P: </span><span>I look at the edges, at students making digital zines to artists creating digital experiences to engineers pushing the boundaries of code.&nbsp;If you spend all your time looking at your peers’ work you just optimize. If you spend time looking for patterns in the weak signals, you can find just enough direction to help you evolve beyond the others.</span></p>",

    "post_content": "<p>We invited the NYC publishing community to share insights on monetization strategies in the industry.</p> <!--more--> <p>On June 19, Bibblio hosted the fifth edition of the 'Future of Media &amp; Publishing' event series at WeWork Penn Station. Special thanks to our sponsor <a href=\"https://www.marfeel.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marfeel</a> (who helped us put together an event which made us forget all about that certain festival that was going on in Cannes).</p> <p>The evening featured a panel with contributors <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-kaufman-32bab53/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Kaufman</a> (VP <span>Client Development</span> at Digital Trends), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-bartner-indeck-679494/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Bartner Indeck</a> (CEO &amp; Group Publisher at Den of Geek US), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedra-pavlou-11920b9/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fedra Pavlou</a> (Senior Vice President at Texere Publishing) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnabulford/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Donna Bulford</a> (Chief Revenue Officer at Animation World Network). <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/xavierjenkins1/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xavier Jenkins</a> (Strategic Partnership Manager at Marfeel) moderated the panel.</p> <p>The evening was kicked off by my colleague and Bibblio CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bibblio/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mads Holmen</a> who handed it over to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-stewart-a6b202b/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Stewart</a> (Strategic Partnership Executive at Marfeel) to share a few words on the sponsor's behalf.</p> <p>Read on for the highlights from both presentations, followed by a write-up of the panel.</p> <h2>Publishers' return to self-reliance</h2> <p>Bibblio's Mads Holmen began with a presentation on how to navigate the <i>attention economy</i>. He described we now live in a world where the availability of eye-balls is vital for growth, as Mads explains by quoting Netflix CEO Reed Hastings:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Back in 2017, Reed famously said that their biggest competitors aren't Amazon or YouTube - it's our need to sleep. Recent studies show that Americans sleep almost an hour less than they did 10 years ago, so you could say he's actually winning? Until we see a huge revival in nature walks, then this is the situation we live in.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>A handful of companies are dominating in this new economy, with Google and Facebook leading the charge. The vast majority of ad growth is going towards these gigantic companies. There are two main reasons for that: one is the availability of data and the strong targeting capabilities that come from that, second is the immense scale any one of these platforms can offer.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc05-mads-holmen.jpg\" alt=\"Mads Holmen, CEO of Bibblio\"> <figcaption>Mads Holmen, CEO of Bibblio</figcaption> </figure> <p>In this world, Mads is seeing publishers changing their way, diversifying beyond advertising and becoming more self-reliant:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"More and more content will not be funded by advertisement alone. What I'm seeing in the market is that publishers of all shapes and sizes are adding revenue channels such as events, affiliate, e-commerce, sponsored &amp; branded content, lead generation and more.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Having these different channels in place has made publishers more sustainable. Mads emphasized that particularly content businesses in the special interest and B2B markets are doing well. He went on to explain how Bibblio is helping publishers improve their monetization by offering tools such as 'Promotion', which features publishers' own revenue-generating content to a naturally engaged audience across their site:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"The Bibblio tech understands which monetized content or offers are relevant where, placing recommendations on your pages that are sure to appeal to interested users.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"diversion\">Learn more <a href=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2019-06-19-FoMPNYC-Bibblio.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download Mads's presentation</a></p> <h2>Easy to use, fast mobile experiences</h2> <p>Next up, Ryan Stewart delivered a quick introduction to Marfeel by asking us to take out our phones and go to The Washington Times site.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc05-ryan-stewart.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Stewart, Strategic Partnership Executive at Marfeel\"> <figcaption>Ryan Stewart, Strategic Partnership Executive at Marfeel</figcaption> </figure> <p>Committed to continually improving the mobile experience, Marfeel brought a boost to this publisher by upping the site speed with instant loading of less than 0.7 seconds. It also delivered an app-like experience, smooth swiping navigation, navigation levels and more.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Learn more <a href=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2019-06-19-FoMPNYC-Marfeel.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download Ryan's presentation</a></p> <h2>When display advertising isn't enough anymore</h2> <p>Then it was the panel's turn, which covered different ways for publishers to make money, whether content is still king, and how to drive more people to your site.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc05-panel-xavier-jenkins.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Kaufman of Digital Trends, Jennifer Bartner Indeck of Den of Geek US, Fedra Pavlou of Texere Publishing, Donna Bulford of Animation World Network and Xavier Jenkins of Marfeel\"> <figcaption>Josh Kaufman of Digital Trends, Fedra Pavlou of Texere Publishing, Donna Bulford of Animation World Network, Jennifer Bartner Indeck of Den of Geek US and Xavier Jenkins of Marfeel</figcaption> </figure> <p>After introductions, moderator Xavier from Marfeel asked the panel about revenue strategies. What have they dealt with historically and what does the mix look like now? Jennifer from Den of Geek US went first and said the times that you could get away with just online display advertising are over:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"You have to diversify in order to be successful. For us this means having channels such a print magazine, custom video, pre-roll ads, header bidding and direct campaigns. The publishing industry is constantly changing, and you need to be able to protect yourself against those changes.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Protecting yourself from the changing tide, doesn't mean all bets are off. Den of Geek US has really enthusiastic, but discerning users, Jennifer exclaims. You have to invest in quality content, and that also means curating advertising that people want to see. And no, Jennifer concluded, not all pre-roll is created equal.</p> <p>Donna from Animation World Network (AWN) agrees with Jennifer and mentions you don't want people encountering random video ads, but instead to only be shown what is relevant. It's important to be true to your company's content strategy. For example, Donna states that AWN wouldn't run an insurance ad from the programmatic feed or publish content that's not about animation and visuals effects.</p> <h2>Is content still king?</h2> <p>Fedra from Texere Publishing has a strong belief in the winning strategy for their publishing business. In her eyes, content is still absolutely king:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"<span>I don't think we'd be able to compete in the scientific and medical markets if we didn't have the quality of content we put out there. For us it's about building professional networks who go on to eventually become our opinion leaders and advocates. As our readership and influence grew, the advertising dollars followed.</span>\"</i></p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc05-audience.jpg\" alt=\"The audience at the fifth Future of Media &amp; Publishing New York\"> <figcaption>The audience at the fifth Future of Media &amp; Publishing New York</figcaption> </figure> <p>Josh from Digital Trends has a different take. He argued that although it's extremely important to have relevant content that your users gravitate towards and engage with, the real \"king\" in 2019 is having the ability to merge that content with commerce. Josh gives an example:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We often put together a four-part, custom video series for the large consumer electronics brands we work with. In these videos we focus on the values, aesthetics and technical features of a product (suite). As part of this we also make the 'click-to-buy' option seamless, on and even off our site.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>Driving traffic to your most valuable content</h2> <p>Before the online order takes place, how does Josh actually drive traffic to the sponsored video series? He mentions that it's about amplifying content off your site:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"It's important to be where users would naturally find us, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube and Twitch. If you're looking at traffic trends at Digital Trends, you'd see that less than 10% is direct. Most people come in through the side door - 40% of our traffic comes in from social posts. The other 50% comes in through general search.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Donna's strategy involves driving her most loyal audiences to branded content, such as subscribers or people from direct traffic. She works with other publishers, social media agencies and influencer networks to drive traffic as well:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Influencers are getting good at being transparent and consumers appreciate that. It's definitely been a great way to have readers engage with our branded content.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Jennifer does not pay for traffic to their branded content. At Den of Geek they believe in investing in getting the right writer and unique hook, so the readers want to read it. It's part of the \"sensible partnership\" she wants to create between their advertisers and their users.</p> <h2>Bonus: Events are an exciting new growth area</h2> <p>During the panel it became clear that - next to sponsored and branded content, lead generation (through content marketing) and advertising - events are a growing revenue stream. Fedra doesn't plan for Texere to be huge exhibition providers, but their sponsored events are making a difference:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"<span>We are experts in our niches and know the big players and influencers well. We have been growing our virtual and live events business more recently and it currently drives around 10% of our total revenue. I believe that focusing on niche and small, virtual events could be key to make a growing impact while keeping the costs down</span>.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Jennifer states that events are important for their audience as they are very engaged entertainment enthusiasts. Den of Geek US doesn't put on their own events but chooses to partner up:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We'll work with Comic Con, for example, and put on an event at these bigger trade shows. We'll distribute our print magazine there in a controlled manner - from that we can make anywhere between 60-100K USD each time.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>A big thank you to all attendees and contributors! We had a great time and will be back in NYC for the next Bibblio publishing event on the other side of summer.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>We at Bibblio were invited to '<span>PACE: The Future of Content', an event hosted by our development partner <a href=\"https://pragmatic.agency/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pragmatic</a>, with a particular focus on content-driven businesses, publishers and brands that publish.</span></p> <!--more--> <p>On 27 June 2019, I attended this London event and enjoyed talks by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gina-roughan-444aa13/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gina Roughan</a> (Director of Content Services at Zone), <span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitry-shishkin-bb9b88/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dmitry Shishkin</a> (Chief Content Officer at Culture Trip), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gayflashman/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gay Flashman</a> (CEO at Formative Content) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlockie/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">David Lockie</a> (CEO at Pragmatic). The afternoon was hosted by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidajsavage/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Savage</a>, who runs the Tech Talks podcast. </span></p> <p>Thanks to David and the Pragmatic team for putting on an interesting event! Read on for my takeaways from each talk.</p> <h2>Specialist content, data and authenticity FTW</h2> <p>Dave kicked off the event with mentioning three things he thinks will continue to win the attention of people. Firstly, people face specific problems and they want specific answers:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"If you were starting a blog today, you certainly wouldn't start a blog on generalist marketing. Specialty is key, to make you stand out in the ocean of podcasts for example.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Secondly, Dave believes data is going to play an even bigger role. He notices it from his own behavior as he tries to get a grip on engagement around the podcast episodes he puts out there. The last thing Dave does before he goes to bed at night is check how many plays the podcast has had - and it's the first thing he does in the morning.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-pace-dave-savage.jpg\" alt=\"Dave Savage, host of the Tech Talks podcast\"> <figcaption>Dave Savage, host of the Tech Talks podcast</figcaption> </figure> <p>But while data is brilliant, Dave exclaims, it also told Netflix that Adam Sandler was the biggest film star in the world (and he doesn't believe that to be the case). Quality is absolutely key, and good content is driven by authenticity and passion. He drove this third point home by telling the story of The Startup Van - two guys kicking off a channel for entrepreneur entertainment by parking a Volkswagen van right outside Web Summit, and getting the greatest minds in there to do an interview, for free. The sponsors followed soon after.&nbsp;</p> <h2>The era of the customer is here</h2> <p>Gina from Zone, part of<span> Cognizant UK, shared her insights in the first talk. Her introductions tell us we have arrived</span> in the 'Age of the Customer', as companies who put the customer at the heart of their business are winning. Just look at Amazon and Netflix.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-pace-gina-roughan.jpg\" alt=\"Gina Roughan, Director of Content Services at Zone\"> <figcaption>Gina Roughan, Director of Content Services at Zone</figcaption> </figure> <p>Surveys show that customer experience (CX) is found to be more important than price, which makes it integral to commercial success. Gina concludes: \"We all know this. As humans we want something that's seamless, easy-to-use, really clear in its communication, informative and entertaining.\"</p> <p>To reach the level of great CX, creative intuition alone is not enough. This needs to be interwoven with data and technology. But beware of the limitations, Gina mentioned, as GDPR and/or working with platforms for children bring limitations for the latter two categories.</p> <p>For the future of content, she'd like to take personalisation to new heights, ridding the internet of spam and bad targeting by brands worldwide, bringing back the creative, human factor. The way for data to support the 'humaneness' is to target actionable audience insights.</p> <h2>Let user needs drive your content creation</h2> <p>Next up was Dmitry, CCO at Culture Trip. Before joining the global 'hyper-growth startup' earlier this year, he worked at the BBC for over two decades leading <span>digital development of many news websites in foreign languages. Dmitry quipped he was offered his current job due to a LinkedIn post the people at Culture Trip stumbled upon, so he highly recommends posting on the professional social network platform.</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-pace-dmitry-shishkin.jpg\" alt=\"Dmitry Shishkin, Chief Content Officer at Culture Trip\"> <figcaption>Dmitry Shishkin, Chief Content Officer at Culture&nbsp;Trip</figcaption> </figure> <p><span>Culture Trip is a media business which operates on the intersection of travel and entertainment, currently amassing 20 million monthly users to their platform which they monetize through affiliate links. They work with many, local contributors around the world. In his talk he zooms in on the role he had at the BBC and has at Culture Trip - being a mediator between editorial and product.</span></p> <p><span>To push both departments to deliver their very best, Dmitry talks about determining specific target groups based on their needs. At Culture Trip they have found distinct groups with particular, cultural mindsets such as: 'Update me', 'Educate me', 'Inspire me' and 'Divert me'. However, t</span><span>here are some notions that are true for (almost) everyone, Dmitry explains:</span></p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Nobody wants to be a tourist anymore - everyone wants to go off the beaten path. We dug a bit deeper and we found that people are still interested in the popular sights, but with a twist. People want to experience 'slow' and 'fast' culture: not only museums, but also street art. Not only restaurants, but food courts as well.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Not only do you need to look at user needs, but also at what stage they are, and create specific <em>content products</em> for it - items with a specific format, goal and expiry date. A few stages Dmitry points out are \"Inspiration\", \"Orientation\" and \"Booking\", but also \"During the trip\" and \"After the trip\". SEO is vital for creating strong content for the stages. That's why Dmitry pulled in the Head of SEO into his senior leadership team - to send a strong signal to the entire organisation too.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-culture-trip-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"Culture Trip's homepage (July 2019)\"> <figcaption>Culture Trip's homepage (July 2019)</figcaption> </figure> <p>The next challenges for Culture Trip are a) getting even better at classifying users according to their needs and b) communicating to internal commissioners and external contributors what content they exactly need. Dmitry will continue to focus on getting people's attention at the top of the funnel (\"Inspiration\") - to be there for people who've only just started thinking about a trip.</p> <h2>Position your brand as trustworthy</h2> <p>Gay, founder and CEO at Formative Content, has a similar focus at her corporate marketing and media agency.&nbsp; In her talk, she explains her goal for clients is to build them brand awareness through mostly organic traffic to the top of the funnel content. The secret sauce to making this happen is bringing clever storytelling to complex subject matter and focus on what makes the brand different.</p> <p>Gay depicts the challenging background in which people in media and publishing are now working in - there's a crisis of trust in content among audiences. It's also an opportunity, she explains:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Organisations worldwide, especially large corporations, can position their brand as trustworthy, through what they say and do. It's about getting attention, connection with audiences and building trust.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-pace-gay-flashman.jpg\" alt=\"Gay Flashman, CEO at Formative Content\"> <figcaption>Gay Flashman, CEO at Formative Content</figcaption> </figure> <p>To see this in action, Gay shares about the work Formative Content have been doing for the World Economic Forum to support their mission to \"make the world a better place\". Formative Content acts like a newsroom for the Forum, with two editorials meetings daily. They publishing many posts on site and social, including 50 videos a day. Gay called it a quality, volume play:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"It's about turning up every day and turning it out all the time. Building trust takes time, and you have to keep speaking to your audience. I recognize that this (volume play) would be a challenge for smaller organizations - it's about being consistent whatever you choose to do.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>Purpose will guide content businesses in the world of games, robo-journalism and AR</h2> <p>The last presentation of the afternoon was by David, founder at Pragmatic, a WordPress agency and the organizers behind the PACE event series.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-pace-david-lockie.jpg\" alt=\"David Lockie, CEO at Pragmatic\"> <figcaption>David Lockie, CEO at Pragmatic</figcaption> </figure> <p>He kicked off by confessing he spends lots of time on Twitter, and he's brought a 'filtered version' of what he comes across on the future of content to us attendees.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some brands are navigating their way to the future of content successfully. He's particularly impressed by Red Bull, who went from (just) selling sugary, caffeinated drinks to being a full-blown, purposeful media company. He mentions the recent Red Bull venture into <em>esports</em> as well.</p> <p>David declares the future of content is \"totally nuts\" (but good to keep an eye on to see where the world of content's heading). He shows us some examples to back up his claim:</p> <ul> <li>AI content creation. The example given was Dreamwriter, a Tencent-designed robot journalist that takes input from, in this case, audio - and video streams at a conference, and publishes an article, including images, quotes and summary, seconds after a speaker left the stage. Read more about Dreamwriter and other AI content creation tools in this <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/chinas-news-agency-is-reinventing-itself-with-ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Niemanlab article</a>.</li> <li><span>Chatbots. One-to-one search engines could become mainstream soon. The chatbot looks at your particular data set and your particular query, then comes up with the answer you need (and not a result page you have to scroll through and assess). This chatbot could very well have the face and voice of your favorite celebrity too.</span></li> <li>Augmented Reality 'try-on' technology. David shows us the example of tech that allows the user to view a different hair color in live mode. AR has come a long way, and automatically detects the user's hair strand by strand. This results in a high quality 3-D view.</li> </ul> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-modiface-simulation.jpg\" alt=\"ModiFace 3D Video Hair Color Simulation\"> <figcaption>ModiFace 3D Video Hair Color Simulation</figcaption> </figure> <p>David continues talking about how to monetize the amazing content we have been and will be creating. He believes the current ad-model is broken and favors innovative ideas such as the services offered by Coil. They send payments via the open standard Interledger Protocol, which allows any currency to be used for, among other things, paying publishers when readers consume your content.</p> <p>Thanks again for the invite, Pragmatic team! I very much appreciated the shout out to Bibblio in David's presentation during a segment on recommender systems too. I'm looking forward to the next PACE event.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>With so much negative coverage of publishing, we at Bibblio are shining a spotlight on the many vertical publishers that are thriving. Welcome to the \"Vertical Heroes\" series of interviews.</p> <!--more--> <p>In this sixth edition, <span><a href=\"https://www.boxrox.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BOXROX</a> Editor-in-Chief Robbie Hudson and Senior Account Manager Clemens Limberg share the success story of their web magazine for competitive fitness and functional sports. </span>Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen had a chat with Robbie and Clemens about taking responsibility as a media business for shaping culture, the importance of a detailed SEO plan (and doing the hard work), and their impressive revenue growth through consistency.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Who is the BOXROX target audience?</strong></p> <p>Robbie: People aged 18–50 with a keen interest in sport, health, fitness and nutrition. We have a fairly even split between female and male readers which I am happy about. A passion for CrossFit and Functional Fitness is the core interest that unites our audience. Our top countries in terms of readership are: USA, UK, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Turkey, Portugal, Greece and Spain.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-robbie-hudson.jpg\" alt=\"Robbie Hudson, Editor-in-Chief at BOXROX\"> <figcaption>Robbie Hudson, Editor-in-Chief at BOXROX</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: What different types of content are you offering the fitness enthusiasts?</strong></p> <p>R: The latest news from the CrossFit and Functional Fitness scene, training tips, workouts, nutrition, stories from the community, a female specific section, psychology and athlete interviews, among others.</p> <p>My aim is to create content that solves problems for our readers and helps them improve; whether that is to get their first pull up, build muscle, win a large-scale competition or overcome an anxiety disorder that stops them from training at all (all true cases). I have used those examples to illustrate the wide variety goals and abilities that are prevalent across our audience. The vast majority of our content is written, but we also produce video interviews.</p> <p><strong>M: How large is BOXROX in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p>R: Leo Marose and Stefan Berntheisel are the co-founders, Kristiyan Katsarov handles IT and tech, Clemens on business and accounts, <span>Carolina Kyllmann</span> and I are the editorial team. We work with an extended network of over 250 contributing writers as well. These include top elite athletes, coaches, nutritionists and some of the biggest names in our niche.</p> <p><strong>M: BOXROX has managed to grow impressively, what has been the secret sauce?</strong></p> <p>R: The 'secret sauce' has a few ingredients. Firstly, consistent solid content – The internet is full of mediocre content, so don’t make it. When I think about an article that I wish to create, I try to match that with a contributor that has the best credentials then create from there. For example, if we create an article on improving endurance for running, then I will try to speak with a former professional ironman and elite coach in order to get all the info first hand. I am a fan of primary sources.</p> <p>Secondly, create content that solves specific problems – We create a lot of content for masters, teenage athletes, beginners, female athletes and so on. We produce content that helps people in a specific way, so therefore it is useful and they want to share it and talk about it naturally.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p>Thirdly, set primary objectives for everything that you do so that everything can be measured and tracked. The KPIs are relative to the SMART goals that I set. For example, Facebook is primarily a way to bring traffic to the website. Links generally do not perform as well as photos or embedded videos on Facebook (based on their algorithm), but a slightly lower engagement rate is fine because the primary goal is traffic.</p> <p>Fourthly, have a highly detailed SEO plan – We tackle singular words, phrases and long tail SEO keywords in a systematic and rigorous way. At the moment I have a list of 500 that we are working through. We do the research, then we do the hard work.</p> <p>Fifthly, mistakes are OK – At BOXROX we test content ideas with specific goals. If they don’t work then we refine them or move on. It’s fine to fail, so long as it helps you create better ideas and content. There's a good combination of creative insight, intuitive thinking and wilder ideas underpinned by data tracking and objective analysis. Because of our structured posting schedule and SEO plan, these additional projects will either bring extra audiences or do nothing at all (and we learn from them), so it’s a win-win situation.</p> <p><strong>M: Could you elaborate on your SEO strategy?</strong></p> <p>Clemens: With SEO you have to get the structural basics right and then build on that foundation. Your pages need to be optimised with the correct keywords and they need to load quickly. From there you can be creative, experiment and find what works for you.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-clemens-limberg.jpg\" alt=\"Clemens Limberg, Senior Account Manager at BOXROX\"> <figcaption>Clemens Limberg, Senior Account Manager at BOXROX</figcaption> </figure> <p>Everyone is looking for ways to ‘hack’ this or that, but there is no substitute for well written content. As search engine algorithms evolve, it will continue to shift in favour of quality.</p> <p>We completely ignore the readability scores for our articles because they dumb down and oversimplify the language. We believe that people are capable of understanding complex ideas, and we see it as a form of cultural hegemony that we do not wish BOXROX to be a part of.</p> <p><strong>M: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper? </strong></p> <p>R: We have a decent rate of returning visitors every month, and we listen to what they say about what they want to read.</p> <p>In terms of new audiences, we have extended our spheres to cover fitness, health, nutrition and training beyond the scope of CrossFit. By its very nature CrossFit is an amalgamation of different disciplines, so our tactics fill well with the subject matter at hand.</p> <p><strong>M: How are you retaining the audiences at BOXROX?</strong></p> <p>C: I think we have to look at different areas here. Firstly, re-targeting via Facebook ads and other social platforms is definitely something we do, especially with our paid content from clients. This works very well for us since our content shows very strong organic reach on social media despite Facebook’s algorithm changes in the last years.</p> <p>Secondly, retaining readers has a lot to do with the content and how it is presented. This includes user interface and user flow, design, readability, writing style, use of images and interactive elements. We are currently looking into a re-design of our site to make it more reader-friendly.</p> <p>On top of this we have recommendation widgets and cross-links to keep readers on BOXROX and get them in touch with more content. Since we are the most-read magazine worldwide in this market, we have a strong fan-base and a lot of people that get all their information from our platform. This helps too! And in the end, if you already have a lot of readers, great content helps, and our team does a great job.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: What are the key audience metrics you define success by? </strong></p> <p>C: Unique users and page views are the two most important metrics. We track hundreds of other metrics, allowing us to make subtle and reactive changes and improvements, but those two are the most important in terms of defining our success.</p> <p><strong>M: What’s your social media strategy?</strong></p> <p>R: We post seven times a day on Facebook - four posts are always new articles from BOXROX. One post on Instagram (with traffic as the primary objective). All articles are auto-posted onto Flipboard. Facebook and Instagram are absolutely necessary for us. We definitely monitor changes, trends and emerging social media tools, but without clear goals they can become voids that simply swallow time.</p> <p><strong>M: How do you drive engagement when readers land on your site? </strong></p> <p>R: We use CTAs within articles to guide and stimulate discussion. We also cover topics such as transgender athletes and performance enhancing drugs bans which always create fierce debate among our readers. With these topics I am careful to present the facts as they are made available, and speak to the athletes personally whenever possible.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-boxrox-article.jpg\" alt=\"BOXROX does not shy away from controversial topics\"> <figcaption>BOXROX does not shy away from controversial topics</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: Would you describe BOXROX as data-driven?</strong></p> <p>C: Definitely. Because the founders of BOXROX magazine have a background in IT and social media, we focused on specific KPIs early on. We have designed our own KPI dashboards over the years. Currently, over 100 KPIs help us to classify the relevance of our content for the reader, but also to evaluate new projects and their benefits. As a result, we are very fast in the final decision-making processes and have been growing our readership between 100% and 250% each year since 2013.</p> <p><strong>M: Can you share some stats on the business to illustrate this growth further?</strong></p> <p>C: I guess the most impressive would be our readership increase since mid-2014. This would be 4200% since then. Our Facebook followers have grown by 1700% as well. In terms of revenue, this has increased by 760% since I started working at BOXROX back in October 2014. Out of our total revenue last year, 30% of the money came from content marketing and I believe this part will grow in the future.</p> <p><strong>M: Could you shed a bit of light on content marketing and your other revenue models?</strong></p> <p>C: Right now, the vast majority of BOXROX’ revenue comes from B2B advertising through direct sales and agency partnerships. Due to our highly engaged audience, the high-quality content and CTRs others only dream about, we are in a solid position to deliver ROI for client campaigns. My goal is to provide a 7-star customer service and consulting before, during and after the campaign. And it shows: the majority of our clients has been with us between 2–5 years.</p> <p>In addition to this we also use AdSense. We have done a lot of work to adjust parameters. This is now bearing fruit as we have very high CPMs paid from advertisers to be shown on BOXROX.</p> <p>We are also looking into new ad formats, video content, subscription models and other ways to generate revenue!</p> <p><strong>M: How do you drive site visitors to the sponsored content?</strong></p> <p>C: We are in the great position to be able trust our four main channels (organic, direct, social and referral) to bring a great amount of traffic. We also utilise paid options and target very specific custom audiences, usually via Facebook and Instagram. Our newsletter and browser notifications do the rest to make this the best possible client experience.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: What’s the area you're most excited about?</strong></p> <p>C: From a business perspective, it is major partnerships with lifestyle brands, agency cooperation and looking deeper into AdSense and AdX. From a growth perspective, it's Google AMP and Google News as well as Instagram and other smaller social networks which are very promising.</p> <p><strong>M: Why do you think your model has been successful?</strong></p> <p>C: In one word: consistency. We’ve seen many, many blogs and so-called “magazines” popping up over the years and only 1% has been able to make an impact. If you don’t get traffic and earn money fast, you will be out of business quickly. We are proud to be still privately owned and that has also been a reason why we grew so quickly over the last 7 years: it allows for quick decision making!</p> <p><strong>M: From your own journey, what do you think other vertical publishers could learn?</strong></p> <p>R: Next to the ingredients of the 'secret sauce' I mentioned earlier, it's about me as Editor-in-Chief taking ownership. If the results aren't good, it's your fault.</p> <p>Additionally, I think that it is important to realise that once a digital publication reaches a certain size, they have a responsibility to remember that their actions will shape public thought and opinion. Digital media has enormous potential to manufacture consent for certain issues, and that must be used responsibly, ethically and in a way that progresses public discourse for the better.</p> <p><strong>M: Lastly, which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p>R: Another Escape are one of my favourite magazines in terms of quality of content.</p> <p>Deezen have established a great balance between in-depth content and shorter, more sensational articles that will drive a lot of traffic to their website. They are a good example of how to activate discussion and create a community atmosphere as well.</p> <p>Al Jazeera's channel organises their content exceptionally well. They cover topics in a deeply informative way, whilst allowing for the dynamism required for first-rate news coverage.</p> <script>// <![CDATA[ window.upsettings = {'api_key': 'a1505d156-f72fd-4d18a5ad99d'} // ]]></script> <script>// <![CDATA[ (function(){var w=window;var up=w.Upscribe;if(typeof up===\"function\"){up('reattach_activator');up('update',upsettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};w.Upscribe=i;function l(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://upscri.be/js/snippet.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);}if( w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})() // ]]></script> <div id=\"go-vh-subscribe\"> <div class=\"upscribe-embed\" data-src=\"https://upscri.be/d132ed\">&nbsp;</div> </div>",

    "post_content": "<p>We invited the publishing community to our first-ever publishing event in Philadelphia to talk audience development.</p> <!--more--> <p>On June 18, Bibblio hosted the first edition of the 'Future of Media &amp; Publishing' event series at 1776 Rittenhouse.</p> <p>The evening featured a presentation by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/louischochman/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Hochman</a> (Digital Managing Editor at New Jersey 101.5, part of Townsquare Media) and a panel of contributors - <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/digital-editor-kevin-donahue/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Donahue</a> (Managing Editor at Philadelphia Business Journal), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahbondbutz/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Bond</a> (Founder and CEO at Family Focus Media) and<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesscardinal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Less Cardinal</a> (Marketing Manager at Technically Media). I moderated the panel.</p> <p>Read on for these expert's takes on the transition to digital, sponsored content, how to do social and newsletters well, and what the future holds. Oh, and grab Louis's presentation slides too.</p> <h2>From radio-only to digital too</h2> <p>We kicked off the evening with Louis's keynote talk. He's the digital managing editor of <a href=\"https://nj1015.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">New Jersey 101.5</a>, a news and talk radio station based near Trenton NJ. It’s the flagship station for Townsquare Media, the third-largest radio station company in the country, owning 321 of them and operating 330 local websites.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompphl01-louis-hochman.jpg\" alt=\"Louis Hochman, Digital Managing Editor at New Jersey 101.5\"> <figcaption>Louis Hochman, Digital Managing Editor at New Jersey 101.5</figcaption> </figure> <p>When Louis joined the company in late 2015, it was plain to him that 101.5's digital presence wasn't up to the standard of a brand that big and powerful. But it has gone well for their site, Louis explains:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"When I joined, we had about 500K unique users a month. That's now up to 2M. We hadn’t yet launched our app, which has over 226K downloads. The follower numbers on our Facebook and Twitter were roughly half of what they are now.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>But the transition to digital doesn’t come easily. To this point, Louis <span>discussed chasing views with bad, 'rushed journalism' as a result. A famous example is the CNN coverage of the 2012 Affordable Healthcare Act ruling. Louis explains:</span></p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"In short, if you only read the start of the ruling by the Supreme Court, it meant Obamacare was to come to an end. And that’s what CNN reported. There were 13 minutes between the false tweets and one correcting the record. CNN and Fox both put incorrect stories on their websites. NPR and Time Inc. retweeted CNN’s wrong info. Even Obama himself was reportedly fooled by it. Huffington Post called CNN and Fox out for being wrong — without acknowledging they repeated the same mistake.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>It's not about going viral</h2> <p>Good journalism pays off. Don't try to game the system, Louis emphasized. This is also true for the platforms you use for audience acquisition every day. Louis shares his tips on how to work with social:</p> <ul> <li>Don’t aim for cheap hits and shares — it’s not about going viral. It’s about appealing to a consistent and growing community.</li> <li>Interact with your audience. Answer their questions in threads, messengers and so on.</li> <li>Don’t just farm out your own links with no regard for interaction. Share fun and interesting photos and videos. Start conversations. Be a good and constructive fellow user.</li> <li>Be honest and clear in your headlines. Facebook will penalize clickbait that the reader abandons immediately — and so will your readers.</li> <li>Use tools the way they’re intended. Don’t slam a still photo into a faux video because Facebook likes to promote video. Don’t tell people to vote with angry faces and hearts. It’s not what they’re there for.</li> </ul> <p>Want to learn more about Louis's lessons learned working with an editorial team that's going through a transition? Or curious about the things he thinks New Jersey 101.5 needs to do better? See the link below...</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Check out<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xZy_NWXBOX7HZfR4-X-0s1869kRg7hgP1dMFzewx2-I/edit#slide=id.g59ad0218f6_0_75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Louis's presentation slides and elaborate notes</a></p> <h2>Facilitating a connection between readers</h2> <p>Next up at our event was the panel, which covered more etiquette regarding social media, the importance of newsletters, and how podcasts could be the next best thing.</p> <p>After introductions, I asked our panel where their external referral traffic is coming from. Sarah from Family Focus Media went first and said that their closed Facebook group is the center of their audience:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Currently, the Main Line Parent Community Facebook group has over 27K local active parents. These members are consistently seeking connection and we're facilitating this. The Main Line Parent and Philly Family Community groups are great listening and feedback sources for our team. They are feeders for our email newsletters too, since we're able to ask questions when they request to join a group.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>And as Louis mentioned earlier, Sarah stresses that the group is foremost a place where they and their audience have interactions. For a long time they didn't even push their content in there. The group continues to grow and there are hundreds of posts and responses every day.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompphl01-audience.jpg\" alt=\"Audience members at the first Future of Media &amp; Publishing event to be held in Philadelphia\"> <figcaption>Audience members at the first Future of Media &amp; Publishing event to be held in Philadelphia</figcaption> </figure> <p>For Less over at Technically Media, organic search is their number one traffic source and direct traffic is number two. On the social side, Facebook generates the most traffic to their site, but the engagement through Twitter and LinkedIn is better:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We focus on the tech industry, companies within and jobs they are offering, so naturally the strongest performance comes from LinkedIn. It depends on what metric you're looking at. I'd say for traffic Facebook delivers most, for actions on our site it's LinkedIn and for engagement it's Twitter (feeds).\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>The Philadelphia Business Journal doesn't have an extensive social media presence, with 33K followers on Twitter, 7K on Facebook and 7K on LinkedIn. But LinkedIn is getting decent engagement without much effort at all:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"It has been mostly other people posting our content onto LinkedIn. We're currently focusing on growing our follower base on LinkedIn, and setting aggressive goals. Our newsletter is much more important to us, though. It's easier to hold on to the subscribers you have, then go and find new ones.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>Newsletter top tips</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompphl01-newsletter.jpg\" alt=\"Robinhood Snacks - Lee recommends this daily newsletter with fresh takes on financial news\"> <figcaption>Robinhood Snacks - Lee recommends this daily newsletter with fresh takes on financial news</figcaption> </figure> <p>Following up on Kevin's remark, I find out that all panel guests are currently engaged in work around newsletters. What if you were to start a newsletter at a publishing business today? I asked Sarah, Kevin and Less for their advice. They all agreed that the best newsletters are mostly self-contained and self-satisfying, offering something digestible too. Sarah mentions respecting the medium where you meet the readers:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Meet people on the platform where they are, and don't always drive people to your site to crank up the page views there. This is true for Facebook, Instagram, and your newsletter too. Your newsletter connects with subscribers in their inbox, so deliver value in the newsletter itself. Leveraging strong visuals is an important part of our email strategy as well.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>If he'd start a newsletter today, Less would set one up with quick, digestible bites. He also stresses getting the basics in order, such as mobile responsiveness and accessible design. Make sure to keep testing your assumptions, Less adds, when it comes to newsletters and everything else in audience growth. Kevin adds that you actually need a whole suite of newsletters nowadays: \"At least one of them should be completely indulgent, narrative driven and 100% your brand.\"</p> <h2>Events and sponsored content are moving the needle</h2> <p>It wouldn't be a Future of Media &amp; Publishing panel without a chat about monetization. Kevin shares his thoughts on digital revenue:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Digital is great for reaching people, it's hard as hell to monetize. The pure ad model does not work. On a CPM model you can't drive enough traffic to have a business that really thrives, unless you get to a remarkable scale. It's exceedingly difficult in a particular geographical area to reach any kind of scale. Print is part of the answer for us, the other part is events.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Sarah began creating their print magazines a year after their events started. She always wanted to created a tangible product - a calling card:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Print offers an experience when your audience is unplugged. I believe in the power of publishing high quality, visually enticing content designed to last&nbsp;in print. It sets us apart from digital-only influencers, increases our authority, and attracts new readers in our niche. I could not raise enough to support my team of ten women with digital alone, the campaigns we create with print in the mix are important revenue-drivers.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p><span>Another source of income that has enabled Family Focus Media to gain momentum and make an impact with their clients is sponsored content. Sarah's team has focused on helping clients tell their stories, in favor of banner ads. Of course, it's important to have clear boundaries about what is right for your niche. In Sarah's case, the first question the team asks themselves is&nbsp;</span><em>what do we as parents feel good about promoting to our friends and neighbors?</em></p> <h2>Podcasts and voice search: new frontiers?</h2> <p>On the day that The Atlantic introduced a “daily idea” for smart speakers, I asked the panel what new, exciting projects they're thinking up. Voice search will not be urgently addressed by Less:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Voice search is something that we want do to sometime in the next decade, but it's not on the roadmap for the next year. Video is something I'd like to incorporate more into our strategy right now. Chatbots&nbsp;too. We're working with some cool tools to start answering questions from site visitors about tech companies, jobs or the latest trends. I think it's a great new way to interact with our readers.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Sarah would also like to create more video content and organise more events, which is where the true excitement of connecting directly with their audience lies. Kevin shares this feeling and wants to try to bring this to digital:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"When I see the energy our reporters bring to the attendees at our offline events, I'd love to have them do podcasts. Our reporters have access to so many people with opinions our audience would be interested to hear. It would make perfect sense for us to do that. That could translate into a voice skill down the road.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>In all, the first Philly event was quite the success. We'll be back!</p>",

So we created an interview series called \"Vertical Heroes\".</p> <!--more--> <p>In this fifth edition,<a href=\"https://labiotech.eu/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Labiotech.eu</a>'s founder &amp; managing director Joachim Eeckhout discusses his Berlin-based media platform covering business and innovations in biotechnology. Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen had a chat with Joachim about the impact of page speed, branded content as route to success and their recently launched membership offer.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Mads: Who is Labiotech.eu's target audience?</strong></p> <p>Joachim: We’re targeting all professionals in the biotechnology industry. Our content focuses on European biotech but attracts professionals from all over the world. Some of our content also attracts more general audiences who are looking for information about new technologies in biotech.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-joachim-eeckhout.jpg\" alt=\"Joachim Eeckhout, founder and CEO of Labiotech.eu\"> <figcaption>Joachim Eeckhout, founder and managing director of Labiotech.eu</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: What different types of content are you offering the biotech pros?</strong></p> <p>J: We divide our content into two main categories: news and long reads. Our news is published daily and covers what’s going on in the industry on a day-to-day basis. Our long reads include more in-depth articles such as technology reviews, top lists, interviews, and opinion pieces. As a 'third type' of content, we also have videos we publish through our YouTube channel.</p> <p><strong>M: How large is Labiotech.eu in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p>J: We have over 150,000 monthly users which make our publication the largest in Europe for this topic. Labiotech.eu currently has eleven staff members, divided between editorial, growth and business development teams. Our team is very international. Across eleven people we have nine different nationalities! Berlin is a great spot to attract international talent and develop connections with the biotech and media industries.</p> <p><strong>M: What has been the secret sauce to grow into the leading publication for biotech?</strong></p> <p>J: Great quality content! We, as founders, weren't trained journalists so we had to learn what it means to create quality content. Over the years and thanks to the team we recruited, our content increased a lot in quality to reach a level credible enough for a professional audience. But at the same time, we didn’t lose our identity and kept a casual tone in our articles, making it very distinct from the competition. We’re now recognised as a trusted source of information, often at the forefront of what’s published in Europe.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-labiotech-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"The Labiotech.eu homepage\"> <figcaption>The Labiotech.eu homepage</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: How do you prioritise attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>J: Our priority is to engage our existing audience. We have had constant growth since we started but we never tried to reach millions of people because we know that in the end, our audience is quite niche. To attract a broader audience would mean that we would have to change our focus to more general science and this is not what we want as a media. So our strategy is to focus on making people come back to our website and consume more of our content.</p> <p><strong>M: How are you retaining your audience?</strong></p> <p>J: We use our newsletter and social media channels (mainly LinkedIn) to engage our readers and drive them back to our site. Our newsletter especially has been a great success in the community and many people use it as their only source of information on the European market. We chose to send it only once a week while many competitors are sending daily updates. The result is that their opening and click rate are quite low compared to ours. When we send an email, our readers are usually keen to open it and discover what we’ve been publishing during the week.</p> <p><strong>M: What’s the key audience metrics you define success by?</strong></p> <p>J: We’re using a mix of different metrics to measure our success. We have the usual page views to measure our volume of traffic but we also look closely at quality metrics. We developed a custom metric we call “readers vs. scanners” which gives us a ratio between users reading our articles in depth vs. the one scanning it quickly. This has been a great insight into our content and helps us to understand better how our content is read.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: Define what SEO means to you these days?</strong></p> <p>J: SEO is our first acquisition channel in terms of traffic but not the one we prioritize on in the long term. The traffic coming from Google is voluminous but we find it harder to convert this traffic into recurring users. The reason is that we rank very high on Google for very generic terms such as “HIV cure” or “cancer cure” but the traffic on these keywords is not specialized, so the visitors come once to get an answer to their questions but mostly will not come back.</p> <p>Where SEO is interesting for us is for the more specialized requests, targeting company names or key people in the industry, for example. These keywords work well for us but of course, generate less volume of traffic.</p> <p>We've also focused a lot on page speed lately as we've seen a great improvement in our ranking when our website loads quicker. We decided to redevelop our website from scratch at the end of 2018 with a focus on reducing the load time. The result was that we cut the loading time by half!</p> <p><strong>M: What’s your social media strategy, and how important is it for you to be present on those platforms? What’s the newest trend you’re seeing?</strong></p> <p>J: We always used a mix of LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. Our most successful channel has always been LinkedIn, as it is focused on professionals and fits very well with our content.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-labiotech-linkedin.jpg\" alt=\"The Labiotech.eu Linkedin page\"> <figcaption>The Labiotech.eu Linkedin page</figcaption> </figure> <p>Twitter has always been a “spamming” platform where people who tweet the most get the highest return, so we developed a strategy to adapt to the channel. It seems that Twitter wants to change this dynamic but their algorithm is still giving priority to regular tweets, so we watch the engagement rates carefully but still publish more frequently than on other channels.</p> <p>And lastly, with Facebook we always had to adapt to more casual information. We have good engagement, especially with a younger audience like students but we can’t share every type of article otherwise our engagement rate drops. Since Facebook also decided to focus more of its feed on what your close network is sharing, it’s getting harder for us as a publisher to reach a large audience.</p> <p>We also tried other channels such as Instagram and Reddit with mixed results. We decided to not focus on them at the moment. As a B2B publication, it’s also harder to engage people on “entertainment” platforms such as Instagram, so the choice to not follow the trend was quite easy.</p> <p><strong>M: Do you work together with other publications who write for the biotech industry?</strong></p> <p>J: Not directly. We’re in close and friendly contact with most of the competitors but we don’t have running partnerships with them. On the other hand, we partner a lot with event organisers in our vertical. It’s a great way for us to create and offline presence and interact with our community.</p> <p><strong>M: Would you describe your business as data-driven?</strong></p> <p>J: We’ve always been focused on data, especially when it comes to taking decisions regarding our content, users and acquisition strategy. But data is limited in comparison to qualitative feedback so we try to listen as much as possible to what our readers have to say.</p> <p>Sometimes it’s also gut-feeling! We are the first users of our platform so we also know what would make sense as a user without having to look too much into the data. The data is helpful to back up your idea and feel confident in launching new features or projects.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: Could you shed a bit of light on Labiotech.eu's revenue models?</strong></p> <p>J: We’ve been focusing on advertising from day one. For us, it was the quickest way to generate revenue and create bonds with the key players in the industry. However, we always focused on not having intrusive advertising. For example, we don’t use as much display advertising as we could and we prefer to focus on branded content, which is better integrated on the website. We don’t allow more than 20% of our content to be branded and it seems that this is accepted very well by our audience. It’s been one of our key differentiators in the industry - other publications were not offering modern branded content when we started and this was key to our success.</p> <p>We also ventured into the event business but discovered how hard it is to scale events successfully. In the end, we had to choose between investing most of our resources into growing events or keeping the focus on the media. We chose the media!</p> <p>In May 2019, we decided to launch a membership offer to diversify our revenues and be less dependent on advertising. It’s quite early to say if this will be successful but we have very promising traction and feedback so far. Our goal is to make as much revenue from membership as we do from advertising.</p> <p><strong>M: Could you tell us more about your membership model?</strong></p> <p>J: The publishing industry seemed to switch massively to subscription models after the success of big publishers such as <em>The New York Times</em>. In B2B, the subscription model is just starting to emerge and we think that we can offer a very attractive product to our members without having to put a paywall on our website.</p> <p>The launch offer includes an exclusive article every month and access to small events we organise everywhere in Europe. We also plan to develop more features in the future with a focus on industry reports and community.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-labiotech-insider.jpg\" alt=\"The Labiotech.eu Insider sign-up page\"> <figcaption>The Labiotech.eu Insider sign-up page</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: Why do you think Labiotech.eu has been successful?</strong></p> <p>J: We have a unique position within the industry thanks to our large biotech-focused audience in Europe. A lot of our advertisers like to combine our channel with US-focused channels to reach a large audience. So we complement what was existing by focusing on an under-served segment of the industry. And for the membership, we’ll see how it goes but we think it will be quite successful.</p> <p><strong>M: From your own journey, what do you think other vertical publishers could learn?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>J: Keeping the focus on what matters and being honest with yourself. Over the years, we’ve tried a lot of strategies, some worked, some not. Sometimes you have to persevere but you also need to recognise when a project is turning into a bad idea. The event business, for example, has been a hard lesson for us and the subsequent projects we decided to launch have been more focused on generating value for the platform instead of venturing offline.</p> <p>The media industry is a difficult business and keeping a laser-sharp focus can help a lot on the road to success (especially when external funding is so difficult to attract). We have many ideas we’d like to develop but we constantly have to remind ourselves of what’s the most priority and what can benefit the most on the long term. That’s valuable learning for any publisher, especially of small size.</p> <p><strong>M: Which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p>J: When I started the company, <em>Business Insider</em> was a big source of inspiration. Now the recipe they created is spreading and includes us. I’m looking at more specialised publications too: In healthcare, <em>STAT</em> is a great example to follow. Originally spun out from <em>Boston Globe Media</em>, it rapidly acquired a reputation for investigative journalism in healthcare. Their investigation on the origin of the opioid addiction crisis in the US has been featured on HBO’s <em>“Last Week Tonight with John Oliver”</em>. That’s a great example of how a specialised publication can have an impact on the general public and even lead to policy changes.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>With so much negative coverage of news publishing, we at Bibblio wanted to shine a spotlight on the many vertical publishers that are thriving. So we created an interview series called \"Vertical Heroes\".</p> <!--more--> <p>In this fourth edition,<span> <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Torque Magazine</a>'s editor Emily Schiola dives into being at the</span> <span>forefront of news and events in the WordPress community since 2013</span>. Emily told Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen about recirculation numbers, the hugeness of SEO and how embracing your niche community is key.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Who are your publication's target audience?</strong></p> <p>Emily: These are WordPress developers and beginners.</p> <p><strong>M: What different types of content are you offering the WordPress community?</strong></p> <p>E: We offer advanced tutorials, plugin roundups, interviews with members of the community, case studies, weekly news videos, editorial cartoons, and more.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-emily-schiola.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Schiola, editor of Torque Magazine\"> <figcaption>Emily Schiola, editor of Torque Magazine</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: How large is Torque Magazine in terms of staff?</strong></p> <p>E: Torque only has two full-time members on staff. Myself and our Video Producer/Graphic Designer/Cartoonist Doc Pop. We’re a small team but we put out videos, editorial cartoons, and articles every week. We also have two consistent writers and reach out to community members and leaders in the industry to supplement other content.</p> <p><strong>M: With few hands you've still managed to grow to 500K page views a month currently. What has been the secret sauce?</strong></p> <p>E: One of the biggest tools at Torque’s disposal is the robust WordPress community. There are hundreds of experts all willing to share their experience. This has allowed us to increase our publishing schedule and cover a wider range of topics. We also make a point of really looking at which keywords are performing well and which aren’t to try to anticipate what readers want.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?</strong></p> <p>E: Most of our audience comes from search engines. It’s people that are looking up problem solutions while building their websites. Because of that, our new reader numbers are very strong. Though we love being a resource for people looking for help to specific problems, we also want people to return week after week. At the moment we are putting more energy into cultivating some of these one time readers into lifelong fans.</p> <p><strong>M: How are you retaining your audiences? Turning visitors into regulars - to fans!</strong></p> <p>E: One of the ways we’ve been working to turn visitors into regulars is to be aggressive about internal linking. The more content you can lead someone to, the longer they will stay on your website.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-torque-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"Torque homepage\"> <figcaption>Torque homepage</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: What’s the key audience metrics you define success by?</strong></p> <p>E: The biggest number we look at is of course, page views. That’s the easiest way to see if something is performing or not. Every month I look at how well an author, specific article, or topic is doing and use that to plan future articles. Another metric I love is the <em>Recirculation Percentage</em>. This looks at the number of returning site visitors. This is a big indicator of which days of the week have less engagement typically. By using this number, I’ve adjusted our publishing schedule from every week day to Tuesday-Thursday. This change has already made an impact.</p> <p><strong>M: Could you explain what SEO means to you these days? </strong></p> <p>E: SEO is huge for us. As I said before, a lot of our traffic comes from search engines. SEO, of course, plays a huge part in this. Something we focus on in particular is keywords. We do a lot of research to see which keywords are performing as well as which ones we are missing out on.</p> <p><strong>M: What’s your social media strategy, and how important is it for you to be present on those platforms? What’s the newest trend you’re seeing?</strong></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-torque-twitter.jpg\" alt=\"Torque Magazine's Twitter\"> <figcaption>Torque Magazine's Twitter</figcaption> </figure> <p>E: Our social strategy is to get our content, evergreen and new, in front of as many users as we can - sharing multiple times a day across our social channels. We share our content primarily on Twitter and Facebook, and occasionally on a few other platforms like Reddit or Instagram.</p> <p>Social trends are constantly evolving to keep up with ever-changing algorithms. One new trend that I’ve been seeing is more brands aiming to be approachable and “real” through their social copy. Video content still thrives across all social platforms, so a good strategy would be to incorporate this trend in your videos.</p> <p><strong>M: How do you drive engagement when readers land on your site?</strong></p> <p>E: Little things like linking other articles right at the top, or adding a call to action at the bottom go a long way for getting people to interact more with the website. We see a difference on comments on articles that have a call to action and those that don’t. People need to be reminded to speak up.</p> <p>Another thing we try to do is respond to as many comments as possible. People don’t want to feel like they are just shouting into the void. Showing other readers that you’re listening goes a long way for getting them to comment more often. Sometimes I jump in and answer a question or make a connection but our writers are very good at following up with their readers and continuing to educate.</p> <p><strong>M: Do you work together with other publications in your vertical? </strong></p> <p>E: Torque’s sister publication, <a href=\"https://velocitize.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Velocitize</a>, is geared toward marketers and CMOs. We are often able to collaborate on a topic to cover from different angles. For example we were tasked with covering a study on the digital habits of Gen Z. Velocitize looked at it from the perspective of the best ways to market to this group, while Torque directed an article at site builders. It is a great way to offer readers more resources.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-velocitize-hompage.jpg\" alt=\"Velocitize homepage\"> <figcaption>Velocitize homepage</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: Would you describe Torque Magazine as data-driven?</strong></p> <p>E: We are absolutely data-driven. As I said above, data moves our content strategy. If our numbers are telling us to hit a topic harder or back off we do that. We want to be as relevant as possible and the best way to do that is to listen to what your readers are telling you through data. I think the tools we have now are incredibly advanced on drilling down to when someone leaves an article, but it would be great to get a better idea.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: From your own journey with Torque, what do you think other vertical publishers could learn?</strong></p> <p>E: The biggest tool at our disposal is the people who are using the platform we write about. No matter how broad or niche a publication’s focus is, there’s always an untapped community waiting to share their expertise. Having dedicated writers is necessary to keep any publication alive, but be open to the idea of guest posts or interviews. It’s the best way to make sure you’re covering parts of your topic you might not even know about.</p> <p><strong>M: Which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p>I really love WP Beginner. They are a great place for educational content about WordPress. I also really love National Geographic and The Atlantic for their long-form storytelling.</p> <script>// <![CDATA[ window.upsettings = {'api_key': 'a1505d156-f72fd-4d18a5ad99d'} // ]]></script> <script>// <![CDATA[ (function(){var w=window;var up=w.Upscribe;if(typeof up===\"function\"){up('reattach_activator');up('update',upsettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};w.Upscribe=i;function l(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://upscri.be/js/snippet.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);}if( w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})() // ]]></script> <div id=\"go-vh-subscribe\"> <div class=\"upscribe-embed\" data-src=\"https://upscri.be/d132ed\">&nbsp;</div> </div>",

    "post_content": "<p>With so much negative coverage of news publishing, we at Bibblio wanted to shine a spotlight on the many vertical publishers that are thriving. So we created an interview series called \"Vertical Heroes\".</p> <!--more--> <p>In this third edition, <a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Highsnobiety</a>'s Director of Audience Development Daniel Neumayer discusses their German-based streetwear publication, covering trends and news in fashion, art, music, and culture. During our latest trip to Berlin, Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen had a chat with him to talk about how clickbait got publishers into trouble, the importance of UI and how's he deepening relationships with Highsnobiety's audience.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Who is your publication’s target audience?</strong></p> <p>Daniel: Highsnobiety caters towards an influential community of urban, primarily male young style seekers and brand enthusiasts.</p> <p><strong>M: What different types of content are you offering these style seekers?</strong></p> <p>D: We create our own premium editorial content across print, video, audio/podcast and social, covering the products, ideas, trends and personalities driving contemporary urban youth culture.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-daniel-neumayer.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Neumayer, Director of Audience Development at Highsnobiety\"> <figcaption>Daniel Neumayer, Director of Audience Development at Highsnobiety</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>M: How large is Highsnobiety in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p>D: Our audience reach has grown to 45 million across all platforms globally. The company has grown to over 180 full time employees with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo.</p> <p><strong>M: You've managed to grow impressively, what has been the secret sauce?</strong></p> <p>D: Highsnobiety was founded 14 years ago, long before sneakers and streetwear entered the mainstream. As one of the first blogs – and a true authority – in this area, we have not only benefited from but actively contributed to the huge momentum that streetwear has gained over the last years. Our mission was and still is to be the most influential global brand for culturally connected, style savvy, forward-thinking young men.</p> <p>We are committed to deepening our relationship with and service to our audience by continuing to expand our core media business with the launch of our creative brand studio, Highsnobiety+, insights practice, and e-Commerce offerings. This service to our audience and brand partners is the reason we have grown and are able to scale at such a rapid pace.</p> <p><strong>M: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?</strong></p> <p>D: Our main focus lies on retaining existing users and fostering a highly engaged community. I know that many publishers are saying they're now confronted with the monetization problems of their former clickbait strategies. The difference at Highsnobiety is that our business model has never been built on sheer scale. And this is what enables us to actually walk the walk. We strongly believe that it is a much more fruitful and sustainable approach. Be it on site or on social media, engagement works as a multiplier that has a positive impact on all other areas.</p> <p>Nonetheless, we do have an acquisition strategy for new users in place as well. Getting our content and brand in front of people that have never interacted with us before, gives us the chance to turn them into fans over time, after all. But also when it comes to acquiring new users, we don’t just go for anybody who is good for an extra click. We rather choose our initiatives wisely to attract new readers within our target audience that have a promising potential to become regulars.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\" rel=\" noopener\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: Could you share a bit more on how you turn these into regulars?</strong></p> <p>D: In order to keep our audience coming back for more, we need to understand exactly what they are looking for and especially what they love on our website as well as our other platforms. Of course, different sub-groups of our audience, be it due to age, interests or via which channel they come to us, have different expectations and so we make sure to analyze them separately. With this knowledge as a basis, we tailor our content and the way we distribute it to those different segments.</p> <p>When it comes to content, topicality, expertise or recurring formats are among the factors that we use to build an audience of ever-returning visitors. For distribution, there are channels like organic search, where the above aspects are reflected and help us attract the same audience by building authority over time. Other channels like social media are naturally made for retention. We build strong communities that engage with our posts and thereby get our content delivered on a more frequent basis.</p> <p>Apart from this, newsletters or other means of direct push notifications are another valuable channel since subscribers have actively opted in, several times, to receive updates that we can perfectly tailor to their needs.</p> <p><strong>M: What are the key audience metrics you define success of these strategies by?</strong></p> <p>D: While many companies strive to find a single north star that leads the way for all efforts, we are rather looking at a set of KPIs. Oftentimes, it is easier to accomplish a certain company goal – which is potentially connected to your personal goals – through measures that may negatively affect other important factors.</p> <p>Striving for the most unique users is a great example here. The objective has resulted in dubious clickbait strategies that neglect everything but tremendous click-through rates. In turn, publishers have ended up with audiences that stay for less than 10 seconds and mostly bounce after a quick look at the teased image – not really a high-quality readership and certainly not the outcome that was intended in the first place.</p> <p>For that reason, our set of metrics tries to balance different factors that we see as paramount for the success of Highsnobiety. They are built around four key areas – frequency, quality, volume and efficiency. Of course, these do not only count for the users we get to visit the website. Our audience spans across many different platforms on which we define success in a very similar way.</p> <p><strong>M: What does SEO mean to you these days?</strong></p> <p>D: SEO plays a huge role for us – as it should for every publisher. As a sustainable source of traffic, evergreen content optimized for search is a perfect complement to our news- or opinion-driven articles. Our strategy naturally revolves around the core topics for which we are already the go-to source for our existing as well as new audience. With a mix of high-quality, in-depth content and fast news, we attract readers through search and simultaneously keep them coming back for more by building a “one-stop-shop” around their key interests.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-highsnobiety-fastnews.jpg\" alt=\"Highsnobiety's latest news section\"> <figcaption>Highsnobiety's latest news section</figcaption> </figure> <p>While keywords will probably always play a central role in SEO, things are changing with AI and the ever learning algorithms. For that reason, we are taking a much more holistic approach to SEO than writing plain texts around high-volume keywords. In order to account for the shift towards search intent, we are making sure in our content creation process that users will find what they are actually looking for. We are aiming to become experts in topic clusters that are core to our brand and audience and thereby own all associated searches on Google.</p> <p>Apart from all content-related efforts, we are continuously working on the technical side of things to keep up with the search engine’s crawlers and algorithms. Be it page speed, mobile-friendliness or formats like our “Taps” for AMP stories, it is very important to stay on top of ranking factors and make the site ready for new features and other developments.</p> <p><strong>M: What’s your social media strategy, and how important is it for you to be present on those platforms?</strong></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-highsnobiety-instagram.jpg\" alt=\"Highsnobiety's Instagram\"></figure> <p>D: Social media is more important for us than ever. Only the role of social media is shifting. Of course, we have been affected by Facebook’s algorithm changes in the last years. Gladly, however, we have experienced a less negative impact compared to many other publishers since our strategy has always been built more on engagement than on cheap clicks. It would be absolutely wrong to say that Facebook is dead. We still see a large part of our overall traffic and engagements coming from our organic Facebook feed which is also why we still pay a lot of attention to the network.</p> <p>At the same time, Instagram has taken the lead role as the gateway to our brand. It has become our focal channel where also our most engaged audience lives. For this reason, we are not seeing social media anymore as a means to primarily move users onto our website but rather as an extension of the same. Satisfaction and engagement of our audience is more important than where they consume our content. Thus, our social media strategy is rather aimed at on-platform captivation instead of traffic acquisition.</p> <p><strong>M: How do you drive engagement when readers land on your site?</strong></p> <p>D: There are two ways for us to drive user engagement on site. On the one hand, the content we create aims to do its own magic as we write about topics that our audience is psyched about. Be it news about the latest drops that generate excitement or opinionated pieces where we and our readers have a clear standpoint and want to vocalize it too.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is the user experience and features that we provide to foster engagement. We constantly work on our website to make it a place where our audience wants to spend a lot of time and get lost – in a positive way. Especially mobile-friendliness is crucial to make it easy for our audience to consume and engage with all our different formats from articles to videos to podcasts wherever they are. By building interconnected content cosmoi and an easily navigable UI we aim to provide our users with the most relevant content based on everyone’s interests. Along with all of this, we are starting a dedicated initiative to implement features with which users can interact more with our content or leave their opinion, among others.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>M: Do you work together with other publications in your vertical? In what way?</strong></p> <p>D: We have previously partnered with other publications to cross-promote our editorial content or work together on giveaways.</p> <p><strong>M: Would you describe your business as data-driven? What are you currently doing with regards to data &amp; insights, and what would you like to see happen in the near-future?</strong></p> <p>D: Absolutely. In my opinion, businesses can only survive and grow without a profound analytic approach for a limited time. Insights into the performance of content on site or across social media is just as important as financial reporting. But it is not a matter of black and white. The question should not be whether we base our decisions fully on data or our editorial foresight. Only if the two complement each other, we will achieve the best outcome. Data alone cannot paint the full picture – but it is crucial to confirm conceived measures and help to optimize them.</p> <p>As Highsnobiety is entering new territories from audience acquisition channels to the recently opened Highsnobiety Shop, we are seeing the need to take our business intelligence to the next level. Especially when you try to build a loyal audience or want your users to do more than simply visit the website, connecting data along the entire user journey becomes crucial. Only like this, we are able to focus our efforts on the right people and decide on the most effective and efficient audience development initiatives.</p> <script>// <![CDATA[ window.upsettings = {'api_key': 'a1505d156-f72fd-4d18a5ad99d'} // ]]></script> <script>// <![CDATA[ (function(){var w=window;var up=w.Upscribe;if(typeof up===\"function\"){up('reattach_activator');up('update',upsettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};w.Upscribe=i;function l(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://upscri.be/js/snippet.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);}if( w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})() // ]]></script> <div id=\"go-vh-subscribe\"> <div class=\"upscribe-embed\" data-src=\"https://upscri.be/d132ed\">&nbsp;</div> </div>",

Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen caught up with her to talk about profiling their audiences, being platform agnostic and her inspirations from the publishing industry.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Who are your publication's target audience?</strong></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-serena-guen.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Guen, founder of SUITCASE Magazine\"> <figcaption>Serena Guen, founder of SUITCASE Group</figcaption> </figure> <p>Serena: Our target audience have a millennial mindset and are looking for trips where they can experience the best of local life, integrating with local cultures and doing off-grid activities. We are looking to cater to people who want to get under the surface of destinations rather than just having a superficial experience, and in that way give back to the communities that they’re travelling to.</p> <p><strong>Mads: What different types of content are you offering them?</strong></p> <p>Serena:&nbsp;Social media is often the entry point to our content for readers – offering short-form beautiful and educational ways to engage. The website contains quickly digestible content with destinations, hotels and other city guides that are easier to digest and practical to use. It acts as a toolkit for people who are just looking for inspiration or want to explore all these different places before they even go.</p> <p>The Travel Planner is a piece of technology that we built that will help travellers navigate new destinations. The print magazine looks more like a coffee table book. It offers long-form content – timeless photography and stories that gives a flavour of each destination in a timeless way.</p> <p>All of our platforms’ content is based on tips from locals and experts to make sure that we provide the best and most authentic experiences.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-suitcase-planner.jpg\" alt=\"SUITCASE Magazine's Travel Planner\"> <figcaption>SUITCASE Magazine's Travel Planner</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Mads: How large is your publication in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p>Serena: SUITCASE Magazine is distributed globally and is available in the most important creative and forward-thinking areas in the cities of 90 countries, with over 400,000 readers across our platforms. We do all of this with a team of 18.</p> <p><strong>Mads: You’ve managed to grow impressively with that team. What has been the secret sauce?</strong></p> <p>Serena: Listening to our audience and also constantly reminding ourselves of our mission. Whenever we do something new, we ask ourselves if we’re bringing ourselves closer to our goals.</p> <p><strong>Mads: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?</strong></p> <p>Serena: Our current priority is growth but first we made sure that our current audience is well catered for by continuing to produce high-quality content and valued by giving them perks or inviting them to events.</p> <p>We attract new audiences by working with industry leaders across diverse interest sets from sport to photography and then once they’re on our page, they realise that we have a lot of useful and inspirational content for their travels, so hopefully keep them!</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\" rel=\" noopener\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>Mads: What’s your social media strategy, and how important is it for you to be present on those platforms?</strong></p> <p>Serena: We’ve profiled our audience and we’ve got four content pillars that we try to center everything around: inspire (45% content), stay (e.g. hotels 15%), explore (25%), educate (15%). Instagram is our fastest growing platform but we’re about to start afresh with Pinterest too.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Are there new social trends you’re into?</strong></p> <p>Serena: I love the idea of Instagram hiding the likes button, which they’re currently trialling in a few different markets. I think this will help hugely augment creative expression on the platform and massively improve mental health.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Agreed! On a different tack: What’s your fastest growing area?</strong></p> <p>Serena: They're magazine subscription sales (150% yoy) and audience on the website (100% yoy). It’s really cool to see two supposedly contrarian platforms growing just as fast as each other. I believe it proves that readers truly want to consume different things via different platforms (all of which are not digital) and that they’re willing to pay for high-quality content.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-suitcase-article.jpg\" alt=\"Digital version of SUITCASE Magazine\"> <figcaption>The digital version of SUITCASE Magazine</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Mads: Why do you think your model has been successful?</strong></p> <p>Serena: We’ve always had the approach of maintaining a strong brand and producing high-quality content first and then deciding the platform to communicate it on second. I think that a combination of building a brand that readers are loyal to and being platform agnostic puts us in a much stronger position for the future.</p> <p><strong>Mads: What do you think other vertical publishers could learn from this journey?</strong></p> <p>Serena: Don’t try to be all things to everyone at once, being niche and targeted is the future and helps build a much stronger brand.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Lastly, which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p>Serena: The New York Times (T Studio is also incredible), Financial Times and The Business of Fashion for their business models. Tina Brown for her content strategy when she was an editor for Vanity Fair. National Geographic for its photography. I also draw a lot of inspiration from brands such as SODA Says and Floom, content creators such as Olivia Lopez and art!</p> <script>// <![CDATA[ window.upsettings = {'api_key': 'a1505d156-f72fd-4d18a5ad99d'} // ]]></script> <script>// <![CDATA[ (function(){var w=window;var up=w.Upscribe;if(typeof up===\"function\"){up('reattach_activator');up('update',upsettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};w.Upscribe=i;function l(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://upscri.be/js/snippet.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);}if( w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})() // ]]></script> <div id=\"go-vh-subscribe\"> <div class=\"upscribe-embed\" data-src=\"https://upscri.be/d132ed\">&nbsp;</div> </div>",

So we created an interview series called \"Vertical Heroes\".</span></p> <!--more--> <p><span>In this first edition, <a href=\"https://simpleflying.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Flying</a> founder Arran Rice takes us&nbsp;through the success of his go-to publication for aviation geeks. Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen sat him down to talk about repeat visitor rates, ad revenue, apps and quality content. Enjoy.</span></p> <p><strong>Mads: Who is your publication’s target audience?</strong></p> <p>Arran: We have two main audience pools for Simple Flying. One being frequent flyers who travel a lot for work or pleasure. Our other main audience are aviation geeks, who can probably tell you which plane is flying above their head just by listening to the engine noise.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-arran-rice.jpg\" alt=\"Arran Rice, Founder and CEO, Simple Flying\"> <figcaption>Arran Rice, Founder &amp; CEO, Simple Flying</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Mads: What different types of content are you offering them?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Simple Flying offers a wide range of content. Our main focus is of course aviation news, this could be anything from an airline launching a new route to a story of a passenger being kicked off a flight for stealing an exit sign. Secondary to aviation news we publish a lot of analytical content based on current industry trends. For example: What plane will Qantas order for Project Sunrise (London to Sydney direct flights).</p> <p><strong>Mads: How large is your publication in terms of audience and staff?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Simple Flying gets on average around 2.5 million page views each month. Our aim is to reach 4.5 million page views per month by the end of 2019. Simple Flying currently has 20 staff members. Most of our staff are of course writing up content for the site, then we also have a small video production team, a developer and 2 people in marketing and business development.</p> <p>We don’t believe in working in an office 9-5. All staff members work fully remote from around the world. As the founder, I press for a life over work balance. Staff members can take unlimited time off, travel as much as they want and can be location independent. I'm a digital nomad myself and travel the world full time chasing the sun. A lot of our staff members do the same.</p> <p><strong>Mads: You’ve managed to grow impressively, what has been the secret sauce?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Simple Flying required a large upfront investment to get off the ground and breaking even took a lot longer than expected. Our secret sauce to growth has been lots of good quality content.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>Mads: How do you prioritize attracting new audiences vs. engaging existing users deeper?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Our motto is, if our content is good and there is a good volume of content being created audiences will stick. This is certainly the case, our repeat visitor rate is growing at double digits percentage-wise every month. On a technical side, we allow users to subscribe to a daily ‘aviation digest’ as well as sign up to push notifications for breaking stories.</p> <p>This month (May 2019), Simple Flying will be launching a brand new mobile app for both Android and iOS. This will allow existing users to be more engaged with our content and receive notifications for any major stories. We also work with a number of ‘aviation’ influencers (people who travel the world and review flights) and they work with Simple Flying writing up trip reports.</p> <p><strong>Mads: What are the key audience metrics you define success by?</strong></p> <p>Arran: As a bottom line we always want to increase our users, but drilling further down there is a big push for making users return and lowering our bounce rate whilst increasing time on site.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Could you define what SEO means to you these days?</strong></p> <p>Arran: SEO to Simple Flying is one thing: Good quality content. We believe if we produce good quality content SEO benefits will come. This is certainly true, large publications such as the BBC and Forbes have given us backlinks to aviation stories we broke. These backlinks occurred naturally and go a long way to increasing search engine rankings.</p> <p><strong>Mads: What’s your social media strategy, and how important is it for you to be present on those platforms? What’s the newest trend you’re seeing?</strong></p> <p>Arran: We obviously have profiles on all of the major social platforms and post all of our content on to them. Right now we are doing a big push into video and YouTube. As of late April, Simple Flying is producing daily weekday videos covering an array of aviation topics on YouTube.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/simple%20flying%20YT.jpg\" alt=\"Simple Flying's YouTube channel\"> <figcaption>Simple Flying's YouTube channel</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Mads: Would you describe your business as data-driven?</strong></p> <p>Arran: We look at data on a daily basis, especially traffic and revenue data. We have yield management tools in place to help us make the most out of every impression we get on Simple Flying.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Could you shed a bit of light on how you generate revenue?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Our primary revenue model right now is advertising. To diversify we will soon be moving into affiliate marketing writing about top credit cards, and amazon products. We also plan to start offering paid ad-free subscriptions for our mobile apps.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Why do you think your revenue model has been successful?</strong></p> <p>Arran: As a site, the model has been very successful and there is still a ton of room for growth and diversification when it comes to revenue. Personally, running the site has enabled me to fully realise my passion for aviation and share it with others on a huge level.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><a href=\"#go-vh-subscribe\" rel=\" noopener\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-vh-subscribe-cta.png\" alt=\"Subscribe to the Monthly Briefing\"></a></figure> <p><strong>Mads: Can you share some milestones/stats on the business to illustrate?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Other than the fact we launched in June 2018, and are already achieving 2.5 million page views per month less than 11 months later - not really. Revenue wise there is still a lot of work.</p> <p><strong>Mads: What's the area you’re most excited about?</strong></p> <p>As the Simple Flying audience grows, and ad revenues along with it, it enables us to create even more content focusing on specific geographies. I’m excited for the site to cover more aviation stories from emerging markets.</p> <p><strong>Mads: From your own journey, what do you think other vertical publishers could learn?</strong></p> <p>Arran: Hiring people who work remote, although the management is harder, it can be very successful. Especially for Simple Flying, our staff fly and travel as a lifestyle and this helps our content quality massively.</p> <p><strong>Mads: Which other publishers do you look to for inspiration?</strong></p> <p>Arran: I love Business Insider, they have created the go-to site for everything business. I take inspiration from them as I want to make the go-to site for everything aviation.</p> <script>// <![CDATA[ window.upsettings = {'api_key': 'a1505d156-f72fd-4d18a5ad99d'} // ]]></script> <script>// <![CDATA[ (function(){var w=window;var up=w.Upscribe;if(typeof up===\"function\"){up('reattach_activator');up('update',upsettings);}else{var d=document;var i=function(){i.c(arguments)};i.q=[];i.c=function(args){i.q.push(args)};w.Upscribe=i;function l(){var s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='https://upscri.be/js/snippet.js';var x=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];x.parentNode.insertBefore(s,x);}if( w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent('onload',l);}else{w.addEventListener('load',l,false);}}})() // ]]></script> <div id=\"go-vh-subscribe\"> <div class=\"upscribe-embed\" data-src=\"https://upscri.be/d132ed\">&nbsp;</div> </div>",

My colleague and co-founder of Bibblio, Mads Holmen, played the part of panel moderator.</p> <p>Read on for the evening's highlights and grab Bryan Glick's presentation slides too.</p> <h2>A journey from print to web-only</h2> <p>Bryan Glick shared the story of the digital transformation of <i>Computer Weekly</i>, which started as a weekly technology newspaper in 1966. This makes them rather unique as they're older than most of the companies they write about, Bryan quipped. In 2011 the publication was acquired by <i>TechTarget</i>. They then made the change to become an all-digital publication, with Bryan presiding as the Editor-in-Chief:</p> <blockquote> <p><i> \"When I came on-board in early 2010, they'd had a decade of print advertising decline. The job ad market had moved to other places online and our then clickbait website didn't make up for this. At that time, the Editor-in-Chief's job was very much about managing decline. They brought me in to go all digital and challenged us to try and become a profitable digital publication.\" </i></p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/FoMPLDN-5-Glick-w1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Glick discussing the digital transformation of Computer Weekly\"> <figcaption>Bryan discussing the digital transformation of his publication.</figcaption> </figure> <h3>Publisher or data analytics business - why not both?</h3> <p>So what was Bryan's strategy to turn things around? Firstly, they felt that there was no way to build a sustainable business with display ads as the main revenue source. However, there was very adequate money in truly harnessing the community of IT professionals who were visiting the site. There was an issue though, which was captured in this great quote by Bryan:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"In print you know all your readers, but not what they read. On the web it's the other way around.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/events/FoMPLDN-2019-03/IMG_6680.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan looking back at were they were before they overhauled their business model\"> <figcaption>Bryan looking back to where they were before they overhauled their business model.</figcaption> </figure> <p>In the simplest terms, the solution Bryan and his team chose to pursue was to find a way to combine reader demographics with what they are reading. To make this work they implemented a free membership model, giving users access to premium content. They then had an overview of what each user read. This opened up great revenue streams for Computer Weekly, Bryan explains:</p> <blockquote> <p><i> \"80% of our revenue comes from selling marketing intelligence and leads to IT companies. We are now a data analytics business. We're building up a membership base of IT professionals, including people who make buying decisions, and we register the topics they're reading about. We then work with brands like IBM, for whom we market their whitepaper to specific Computer Weekly members, and the users give consent to be approached with more information afterwards. IBM pays us for this 'lead-generation' opportunity.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>The rest of the generated revenue is from online ads. Bryan says they don't do many of them - the ones they do sell, they sell for a premium price.</p> <h3>Continuous revenue and profit growth</h3> <p>The overhaul of the business model at Computer Weekly has brought them to where they are today: they are profitable and have room to invest in regionally focused content for a number of European and international markets. And the B2B publication means business: in February 2019 they launched ComputerWeekly.de. To finish it off, Bryan drops some numbers:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"On average, we're delivering over 1 million page views a month. For at least the last 5 years we've had revenue growth every year - and we are making profit too. When we sent out our last print magazine it went out to 90,000 subscribers. Now we still do a weekly magazine in pdf, and that currently goes out to 200,000 subscribers.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"diversion\">Want to know more about the digital transformation of this B2B publisher?<a href=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2019-03-07-FoMPLDN-ComputerWeekly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download Bryan's presentation</a></p> <h2>Impacting the bottom line of B2B publishing businesses</h2> <p>Next up at our event was the panel, which covered the impact of social media (spoiler: it's a mixed bag), the importance of newsletters, and how events are driving more revenue than ever.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/events/FoMPLDN-2019-03/IMG_6739.jpg\" alt=\"Panel guests smiling at London publishing event\"> <figcaption>From left to right: Mads fires an amusing question at Mary, Paul, Helen and Esther.</figcaption> </figure> <p>On the topic of audience acquisition, Mads asked our panel how much of their traffic is driven by social media. Helen goes first and says that almost a third of the traffic to UKAuthority comes through social media:</p> <blockquote> <p><i> \"This is split between Twitter and LinkedIn. The end-users are on the former, our buyers on the latter. Lots of our business comes directly through LinkedIn - brands reach out to us to find out how they can get involved.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>The Architects' Journal website receives most social traffic from Twitter, powered by tweeting out stories that generates a wider audience. Mary remembers an article they published about the demolition of a car park.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>\"There was one tweet that nearly got 300,000 impressions, which is mega for us. That brought in a lot of traffic. Most of them would come and go quickly. But they are still served an ad.\"</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Social hardly plays a role of importance for Dennis, traffic or otherwise. Esther explains that they haven't found Twitter to be helpful to reach IT professionals - neither is Facebook. She does remain somewhat hopeful for LinkedIn:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"LinkedIn Groups were a dynamic place where loads of conversations were going on. Two years ago they switched that off. Everyone who has a LinkedIn Group knows that the engagement there has plummeted. They are looking at resurrecting them, but they have been promising that for the last six months.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Paul from Dennis adds his sceptical view on social media generally. He says that when you look at the amount of money that has been \"piled into social\" over the last few years versus the engagement it generates, it doesn't add up for him.</p> <h3>Newsletters and other emails deliver</h3> <p>So what does bring them the engagement they are looking for? It's newsletters, mostly in the format of daily updates and weekly/thematic roundups. Paul mentions they customise them by themes, and on average they get around 15 to 20% open rate.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/events/FoMPLDN-2019-03/IMG_6748.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Kezia Thorpe on the panel\"> <figcaption>Esther explains how offering lead generation brings in most of the revenue.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The newsletters often include a sponsored link to a relevant whitepaper, and the lead generation on the back of that generates revenue for Dennis. Esther describes how this works:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"The brands hand their white-papers over to me, I read these and create a marketing strategy around them, using our own stories and email database. We know our audience well, so we can deliver targeted campaigns.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>A growing revenue stream for them is helping brands to create the whitepapers and other types of content, such as micro-sites or integrated content solutions.</p> <h3>How important is SEO?</h3> <p>According to Parse.ly's <a href=\"https://www.parse.ly/resources/data-studies/referrer-dashboard/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">referral dashboard</a>, Twitter currently drives 2.4% of all traffic to publishing sites. Flipboard does 2.3% and Facebook is responsible for 21%. No one can hold a candle to Google though, with more than half of all referral traffic coming through their search. So we asked our publishers how important SEO is for them.</p> <p>With 50% of their traffic coming from organic search, Mary from Architects' Journal mentions she wants their journalists to look at trending topics and create stories around those more often. And the stories that are created should be written in an evergreen style or set up in a way that they're easy to update:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We want to build up more evergreen stories. Our journalists are not in the habit of writing too much of it. Our website is really built on daily news. We do have features, but these do end up mostly in our print edition. But if you Google 'how far away from a house can you plant a tree?' one of top hits is a quite ancient article from our site.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Paul from Dennis says they are doing plenty on SEO. A couple of years ago they decided to slightly change their tack and now take a niche, quality keyword approach:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"To target a quality audience we're going for keywords such as 'CRM' and 'ERP'. After the audience finds us through these niche terms, they are met with long-form content on our site. This strategy helped drive us up to 5 times the engagement we had before.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>UKAuthority doesn't rely much on Google Search, organic or otherwise. Helen says this is because they have a slightly obscure kind of content. Stuff \"you wouldn't Google\". Around 40% of their traffic is direct, 30% comes from social and another 30% through email.</p> <h3>Events are paying the bills</h3> <p>Earlier in this post we touched upon lead-generation as a big revenue stream for both Computer Weekly and Dennis. Talking about diversification of revenue, Helen spoke enthusiastically about their virtual events branded <i>UKA Live:</i></p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We grew out of a research and market information company, so we never had programmatic advertising and it's not going to give us the revenue we need. We run our business off our data in the form of whitepapers and events. Funnily enough, our virtual events <em>UKA Live</em> have a higher profit margin than our physical events. Our virtual events are not webinars, we film in a TV studio and we broadcast live on a Vimeo stream. People watching can ask questions too. Massively nerdy, great, and a growth area. We also re-purpose the content into smaller videos, podcasts and long-form reads. We sell a solo sponsorship for every broadcast for £6k.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Mary refers to events as an important revenue stream, followed by their print edition. Their digital presence is crucial in driving people to both and it's growing.</p> <h2>Panel bonus: the membership model at Architects' Journal</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/events/FoMPLDN-2019-03/IMG_6752.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Douglas shares insights on Architects Journal\"> <figcaption>Mary explains how Architects' Journal metered paywall works.</figcaption> </figure> <blockquote> <p><i>\"All our focus online is on getting people to register and then become a paid subscriber. As an unregistered user you get one article a month for free. If you want to read a bit more you can register. If you want unlimited content, including in-depth building studies and the latest regulatory and legislative updates, you have to subscribe to a paid plan.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>She feeds back to the editorial team what people are reading via <i>Slack</i> and daily meetings. They've taken this on-board and have written more content on topics that people who visit the site engage with. \"In the last two years we've had 25% growth in traffic to our site\", Mary states. \"Currently, a third of page views are from subscribers.\"</p>",

My colleague and co-founder of Bibblio, Mads Holmen, played the part of panel moderator.&nbsp;</p> <p>Read on for the evening's highlights and grab Anne-Sophie's presentation slides as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h3>Content syndication and diversification of revenue are moving the needle</h3> <p>Anne-Sophie shared the story of The Beam,&nbsp;a tri-annual printed publication covering the energy transition and the race to a zero carbon economy. The publication is available at 2 airports, 500 cafés, 15 satellite publishers, +1100 companies in 50 countries and they have subscribers from 26 countries. Their print magazine has been Anne-Sophie's dream from the beginning, but they have a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@TheBeamMag\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Medium blog</a> too:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"To make our print publication work it was pretty clear to us we needed to be online. Twitter is my favourite social channel. It's a great place to grow our online reach, and get a diverse audience too. The most article views on our blog come through Twitter.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber04-beam.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Media &amp; Publishing Berlin\"></figure> <p>Other social platforms haven't made a huge shift for them. As reports are coming out that, for the first time in a decade,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/facebook-declines-first-time-infinite-dial-history/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook&nbsp;usage is</a><a href=\"https://www.edisonresearch.com/facebook-declines-first-time-infinite-dial-history/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;declining</a>, Anne-Sophie shares her mixed feelings:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Facebook? Well, it's Facebook. We feel we should be present, but it's not doing much for us with regards to driving traffic to our online content or merchandise.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>What is moving the needle for them is syndication efforts with other like-minded publishers:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We share our blog content on the sites of&nbsp;CleanTechnica and FAIRPLANET. This partnership allows us to reach a broader audience and has driven lots of subscriptions to the print edition as well.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Late last year, Media Voices' <a href=\"https://whatsnewinpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Media-Moments-2018-Report.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Media Moments report</a> mentioned the importance of diversification of revenue for publishing businesses. This will be key for the growth of The Beam this year, according to Anne-Sophie:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"To individuals, we offer print subscription. To not-for-profits, we offer distribution partnerships. To companies, we offer sponsored content. This is limited and we retain control on editorial and design. That's important as we believe sponsored content needs to look completely different to opinion or editorial content. To conferences, we offer a free page of advertising in print and social media advertising - in return, they have to pay for our travels and appearance, and become a distribution partner as well.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"diversion\">Want to dive into the numbers behind The Beam? <a href=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2019-02-27-FoMPBER-thebeam.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download Sophie's presentation</a></p> <h3>How are publishers growing&nbsp;their audience?</h3> <p>Next up at our event was&nbsp;the panel, which covered two big questions: how do I&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;my audience and how can I actually make a living from them?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber04-panel.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Media &amp; Publishing Berlin\"></figure> <p>Regarding the first part, all panel guests declared that organic traffic through Google is their most important acquisition channel. Robbie at BOXROX describes it as being at the centre of what they do:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We have an SEO&nbsp;policy&nbsp;in place and we continuously work on that. To have a great number of articles on the basis of that is our golden nugget.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>And it seems to work well, as this month (February 2019) is the first time BOXROX will hit a million unique readers. Accepting articles written by the community (i.e. experts or enthusiasts) is another way to drive a broader, diverse audience and to get the most out of a smaller editorial team, Elena adds.</p> <p>BOXROX also works with a browser push notification that currently allows them to reach 30,000 people, which they use for important news articles. Google's AMP has been great at driving more traffic too.</p> <p>Offline has a great impact as well, also for digital publishing, Elena mentions:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We do a lot of community activities and these offline events are the way many people find out about us.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>LOLA Magazine, which has an online offering, is focused primarily on offline. Jonny mentions they distribute 5,000 copies of each issue throughout Berlin's cafés, art galleries, cinemas and bars:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"LOLA's web traffic is mostly referred from Facebook, which works because of our locality. We utilise digital for telling more of the stories that won't fit in our print magazine that only has 48 pages and gets published every four months.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h3>How can you make a living as a publisher?</h3> <p>Nowadays, digital publishers are finding other ways to make money beyond (programmatic) advertising on their site. Benefiting from your loyal audience through your newsletter is a no-brainer for Elena:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Our strength is the community we've built. The thing we monetize the most is our newsletter. It works well that we can show our advertisers a specific audience being interested in a specific topic. We offer them a paid email blast or just a banner.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>BOXROX relies on sponsorship income, directly signed with a partner. Robbie explains how it works, with packages starting at&nbsp;€1,500:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"That would get you space on a leaderboard banner or one on the side. We also have a pop-up on our site; we have experimented with that to make it as 'not annoying' as possible. Partners&nbsp;can pay for impressions or for clicks, which is more expensive.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Sponsored content is&nbsp;the most premium way&nbsp;for working with BOXROX. The top end of these editorials,&nbsp;€2,500 are way up, and are mostly reviews of products or editors, or Robbie himself following a training program and writing about it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, the majority of the revenue for LOLA Magazine comes from work for brands, dubbed as \"agency work\" by Jonny:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We use our magazine as an advertisement for the work we do in the background; using our writers, photographers and editors to produce articles and media for other people. We could publish this work through their site and ours.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h3>Berlin publishers' outstanding quotes</h3> <p>As an encore to our contributors to the panel, let's finish with some strong quotes:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Speaking from experience, you can pretty much do everything to make a niche publication work with 5 full-timers: at the publication I worked before we had five people doing a hundred-page magazine every month.\" - <strong>Jonny</strong></i></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><i>\"Have a strategy for everything you do. Really be consistent, invest time and be patient. We did a couple of surveys, and our audience really wants to read long-form articles, not news.&nbsp;So we now focus on publishing pieces with more&nbsp;than a thousand words.\" - <strong>Elena</strong></i></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><i>\"If you're beginning and want to grow your publishing business, then focus on working together with people who could offer you content of such high quality you can't find it anywhere else.\" - <strong>Robbie</strong></i></p> </blockquote>",

    "post_title": "Designing a content recommendation module",
    "post_slug": "designing-content-recommendation-module",
    "post_date": "26-Mar-2019 13:02:26",
    "post_content": "<p>Bibblio’s AI-driven recommendation utility connects customers’ articles to the rest of their relevant content. The most common way to do this is through in-page, pre-designed modules. These sorts of widgets are becoming ubiquitous, but how easy is it to design a customizable module to run on thousands of sites?</p> <!--more--> <p>Making a content recommendation module with in-built customization work for as many customers as possible was quite a challenge. It needed to be very robust yet flexible enough to be sure the customer could tailor the design to their site. Starting off we didn’t quite realise the Pandora’s box it would open - what seemed straightforward on paper quickly escalated into an intricate project full of complications, but fortunately the hard work paid off. Here’s our process:</p> <h2>The framework</h2> <p>We started off by creating a framework that could generate recommendations on an article page. Each ‘rec’ would include the title, author, date published, featured image etc. From here we knew the boundaries, at least technically. We also knew that different customers would want the module to vary in layout and style, so we needed to factor this in.</p> <p>With the framework generated in JavaScript we were keen to have the JS file as generic as possible and not limit the uniqueness each customer might need. This left the style sheet as the safest place to inject variety.</p> <p>So we built a module whose parent element could call multiple classes, each controlling different facets, such as layout, tile ratio and effects. These class names can then be added to a module via a module builder, which is essentially a designer’s toolbox for setting the look and feel by toggling features on or off. This then outputs a string of classes to a snippet maker or similar.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-builder.png\" alt=\"Bibblio's module builder interface (version 4)\"> <figcaption>Bibblio's module builder interface (version 4)</figcaption> </figure> <p>The classes can also be manually added by developers accessing the API and module code directly. This had the extra benefit of helping our customer onboarding teams – the class names became a lexicon they could communicate with. If a customer wanted a certain feature and we could provide it, the team member could message them with the appropriate class name, and the customer could append it. This avoids any vagaries during design implementation.</p> <h2>The layout</h2> <p>Websites differ greatly in their design, but there are some fundamentals that content pages invariably follow. These are well known and each site will have several or all of them, such as a wide column to house the body content, an area beneath this content for successive activity and a narrower right (sometimes left) column for sticky content.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-strategy.png\" alt=\"Vertical and horizontal strategies for satisfying user needs\"></figure> <p>The different areas of a page should be geared towards different types of user journeys. For example, content beneath the main body would employ a more vertical strategy since the user read all the way to the bottom and was likely to be invested and interested in the topic. Whereas content in the right column starts much further up and would attract users who are applying a softer touch, skimming the page, with less keenness of interest in the page’s content. These can be drawn to broader topics or redirected entirely through a more horizontal strategy.</p> <p>With all this is mind, we needed module layouts that could cater for both strategies. The classic row-of-three, used by many content recommenders was definitely a starting point. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and it has proved its popularity by being the most used layout of our customers. We offer this layout as the default, so whether it’s actually popular or customers just refuse to deviate remains to be established.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-layouts.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the 16 module layouts available\"> <figcaption>Some of the 16 module layouts available</figcaption> </figure> <p>From there, we went two smaller and one larger, with a row-of-one, row-of-two and row-of-four. We stopped at four because most websites would not comfortably fit any more tiles in a row without them becoming too small and impacting their effectiveness. Also, choice fatigue can set in if there are too many options in a sequence.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean four is our display limit. We’re pulling in six recommendations after all. (We actually supply 20 recs per item, so a developer could do much more with the data if they wanted, such as a ‘search results’ style page or a carousel.) A grid-of-four and a grid-of-six were created, the latter being three tiles across. When recs are stacked in rows the eye can scan and discern more effectively than a long single row.&nbsp;</p> <p>Also for impact we created four showcase layouts that used a larger tile to draw attention to the first rec. A box-of-3 where the second and third recs sit stacked to the right of the first, a box-of-4 similar to the previous but with three stacked (since deprecated in later versions due to the stacked tiles being too small to be effective), a box-of-5 where two large recs sit above a row of three, and a box-of-6 where the second and third recs sit to the right of the first and a row of three tiles sit beneath them all.</p> <p>Lastly, we looked at the narrower columns in most web pages, catering to horizontal strategies. We created a column-of-two through to a column-of-six. In our latest module release (version 4.x) we added two text-only modules after feedback from our customers. So a list-of-three and list-of-six were devised. We have also betaed several mobile-only layouts displaying the next rec anchored to the bottom of the interface.</p> <h2>Another dimension</h2> <p>Next we addressed tile ratios. This initially applied to all tile layouts except the showcases, but in version 4 we brought that flexibility to all types. Each customer has a different preferred width and height for their featured imagery, so we wanted to be sure their pictures would look their best in the tiles.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-ratios.jpg\" alt=\"The four tile ratios\"></figure> <p>The default was <strong>4:3</strong>, the standard “TV” ratio of old, and a common postcard-shaped area. Below this came <strong>widescreen</strong> (16:9) and above it, <strong>square</strong> (1:1). We chose this variety so that customers could adopt the one that most suited their imagery without trimming too much off inside the tile. As we rolled out we received feedback from customers who preferred to use portrait images as their main picture, so we incorporated <strong>tall</strong> (2:3) into our latest module version. This is also great for customers who have books or journals as recommendations.</p> <h2>Style</h2> <p>When it came to the appearance of the tile we needed it to be impactful but not overwhelming on the page. It also needed to look different enough from the offering at that time. The content’s featured image would display as the background, with a watermark pattern as substitute if no image was available.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-style.jpg\" alt=\"Black backgrounds were the safe choice for legibility\"></figure> <p>The title would be written in white with a transparent to black vertical linear gradient behind it, so that it stood out. We experimented with dark text on a white gradient or various colors but decided the effect was too washed out and lost the impact. The other text elements within the tile (three properties: author, date published and site name, and a text preview) maintain a hierarchy of importance based on their proximity to the title and differing levels of opacity.</p> <p>Users could see the text preview by hovering the mouse over each tile. The title and other properties slide upwards to reveal the preview sliding in below it. In version 4 we also have display controls to show the image only, with the title revealed on hover, and title only with the properties revealed on hover.</p> <p>Provision was made to choose the font style of the headline based on a handful of cross-platform system fonts. We didn’t make it too expansive as we wanted to provide a core that we knew would render identically across operating systems, and we knew ten fonts that would. We also created five font size settings from 14 to 22 pixels.</p> <h2>Alternatives</h2> <p>With our default design finalized we needed to cater for the alternative – an image with text beneath it. So we created the “Separate text” format. This started life as a white box with the title and other text elements inside, sitting on top of the image, anchored to the bottom. This worked well but wasn’t too elegant as the white box would eat into the image if the title length was long. Situations with a lot of title length variety made the rows look like crooked teeth. Also, if the preview hover was activated, the content would slide up to reveal the preview whilst obscuring yet more of the image.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-separate.jpg\" alt=\"Titles create a crooked teeth effect, corrected in later versions\"></figure> <p>In version 4 we totally re-wrote the module from the HTML upwards, favouring instead that the title and other text elements sit beneath the image at all times. When the preview hover is now activated, the preview is revealed on top of the title and other text only. As the text did not require a white box to mask the image, this layout could sit smartly on backgrounds that were off-white. We also created an invert class so that all text would appear as white on darker backgrounds.</p> <p>The image also had a little more freedom, with the customer able to set the vertical alignment of their images within the tiles. So for example, if their images were square in shape with the focal point of most of them happening at the top, but aesthetically they preferred a widescreen ratio on their tiles, they could set the alignment to top, and the images would always anchor themselves to the top of the tile. (The default is set to middle.)</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-hover.jpg\" alt=\"The shine and spectrum hover effects\"></figure> <p>We decided to add a bit of sparkle to our titles by including a hover-over effect called <strong>shine</strong>. When the mouse is passed over a tile a white shine slides in from the right corner of the image, using a CSS gradient. In version 4 we went one further and created a <strong>spectrum</strong> effect, using a more complex CSS gradient to make a rainbow appear.</p> <p>All this was made fully responsive, so that the tiles degrade gracefully across devices.</p> <h2>Challenges</h2> <p>There are a lot of moving parts going on here. With over 1,350 possible combinations, there’s a lot of risk that a certain class sequence will cause unexpected results. Any improvement we make goes through a vigorous testing process to ensure that that area of the module performs as expected under all conditions and device sizes.</p> <p>Having said that, it’s a surprisingly robust creature! Even more so in version 4. I mentioned our rebuild earlier – this was a significant departure from the original related content module. Initially we wanted to be as semantically pure and backwards compatible as possible when it came to structure. The module was composed of an unordered list with list items for each tile, containing an anchor that housed spans. (Although HTML5 permits block elements such as headline and division inside anchors, some online code editors are trailing behind and can sometimes declare any block children within an inline as invalid and delete them. We avoid this risk by keeping it all inline.)</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-wordpress.jpg\" alt=\"Related Posts for WordPress by Bibblio plugin page\"></figure> <p>This worked well until we released our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts\">WordPress plugin</a>. The plugin lets WordPress users quickly add the module onto their site, giving them internal recommendations in moments. WordPress is a complex beast, because beyond the standard setup you can choose from thousands of design themes to render your site. You can also pick from thousands of plugins that can handle back-end processing, publishing, AMP delivery, design output – you name it. This makes each WordPress site a “snowflake” (as one of our developers likes to put it) – each one is unique and what works for some might not work for all.</p> <p>Integration with WordPress has been in the main a nice straightforward process. For those that are daisy-chaining plugins in mind-fizzing knots or have re-written entire chunks, there’s always a little more TLC required. But that’s okay, each site is different – we can handle uniqueness. It’s when a theme-producer creates what we call an “overzealous style sheet” that we become frustrated.</p> <p>For example, a theme might contain a style sheet that declares that all unordered lists throughout the site must conform to a certain style, or that every anchor element on the site will react with a certain type of hover effect. These are often blanket classes, swallowing up all parts of the page, including third party plugins. They might nest this overzealousness within named parent classes, but the damage is done – unexpected results occur on unsuspecting plugins. This forces plugin creators to litter their own style sheets with !important declarations to ensure their styles override any indiscriminate theme classes. A frustrating but necessary evil. Site owners might wish to take this into consideration when picking their theme, to ensure easy integrations with UI plugins.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-elements-orig.png\" alt=\"The original semantic structure of the module\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-designing-rcm-elements-v4.png\" alt=\"Improvements to the semantic structure of the module\"> <figcaption>The element depth of version 4 is shallower but the information blocks are segregated to allow for better display control</figcaption> </figure> <p>So in version 4 we did away with unordered lists, keeping instead six anchor elements containing spans. That shored our module up, knowing we would no longer have any surprises from ill-considered classes manipulating the UL or LIs. We just needed to keep the anchor in check and all would be well.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>We’re really happy with where we are right now. We’re constantly listening to customer feedback, as they are closest to the end users. They have a strong understanding of what works on their sites, but always welcome our UI advice to make the most of their page real estate. We’re always exploring new module layouts that can enhance the user experience on both desktop and devices, and are keen for any feedback and suggestions for how we can improve the designs. Our mobile-only layouts are the next step in achieving this, and further forward we’ll be exploring in-content and feed-based interfaces that will drive further pages views and engagement.</p>",

I read the other day that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/30/facebook-fourth-quarter-profits-revenues-earnings\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook posted record profits</a> despite <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-scandals-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">ALL the stuff</a> that’s been going on with them in 2018. Don’t we care at all? Maybe.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-adam-curtis.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Curtis\"> <figcaption>Adam Curtis, filmmaker</figcaption> </figure> <p>Maybe we just don’t know how to. Maybe <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/12/06/the-antidote-to-civilisational-collapse\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Curtis is right</a>. Maybe the world feels too complex and chaotic. He uses the word “HyperNormalisation” - a phrase coined by a Russian historian writing about the last years of the Soviet Union. In the 80s everyone from the top to the bottom of Soviet society knew that it wasn’t working. They knew it was corrupt, knew that the bosses were looting the system, knew that the politicians had no alternative vision. Everyone knew it was fake, but because no one had any alternative vision for a different kind of society, they just accepted this sense of total fakery as normal.</p> <p>Sometimes this is exactly what the modern tech and media landscape feels like to me. We know it’s not working for us, we know we’re being treated as commodities in a state of perfect paralysis - yet we keep on checking Instagram and binging Netflix or YouTube.</p> <p>Escaping the surveillance economy doesn’t feel like an actual option to most people. So are we simply lost in a giant digital coliseum, housing billions of people that can get any kind of entertainment they like, 24/7? What can we do to break out?</p> <p><strong>From actual privacy to practical privacy</strong></p> <p>Maybe<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to start getting somewhere we have to embrace the idea that actual privacy is dead, a utopian dream in our current technology and media landscape. But what about practical privacy? What if you were being tracked still, but nobody could tell if the data&nbsp; was real or synthetically generated on your behalf to obscure? You would in effect reclaim privacy as a practical concept.</p> <p>A friend once mentioned that every superhero has a kryptonite - their super power&nbsp;always has&nbsp;a fatal flaw. So what is the flaw in Google and Facebook’s near-perfect algorithms and data collection capabilities?</p> <p>Data itself, of course.</p> <p>Their super power is also their greatest weakness. It relies on automated data gathering and processing at an almost incomprehensible scale. To quote Adam Curtis himself:</p> <p><em>Using feedback loops, pattern matching and pattern recognition, those systems can understand us quite simply. That we are far more similar to each other than we might think, that my desire for an iPhone as a way of expressing my identity is mirrored by millions of other people who feel exactly the same. We’re not actually that individualistic. We’re very similar to each other and computers know that dirty secret. But because we feel like we’re in control when we hold the magic screen, it allows us to feel like we’re still individuals. </em><em>And that’s a wonderful way of managing the world.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-beat-em-jam-em-jamming.gif\" alt=\"We're jammin'\"></figure> <p>However, all of this power relies on the idea that the data can be trusted. What if we all passively, at a large scale, began to generate data that looked and felt real? Data that was generated by us - but created sarcastically. Fake, but real. What better way to show your human objection to constant data gathering than by throwing a spanner in the works at source. Let’s call it digital activism.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-beat-em-jam-em-parasite.jpg\" alt=\"Parasite\"> <figcaption>Parasite, by Project Alias</figcaption> </figure> <p>I think we are seeing signs of it already. For example, while gathering thoughts for this piece I came across the Parasite.</p> <p>Bjørn Karmann and Tore Knudsen recently created <a href=\"http://bjoernkarmann.dk/project_alias\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Project Alias</a>, a teachable “parasite” that is designed to give users more control over their smart assistants, both when it comes to customisation and privacy.</p> <p>It sits on your Amazon Echo or Google Home and lets you block them and control them in various ways.</p> <p>I then found <a href=\"https://noiszy.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Noiszy</a>. Their tagline is brilliant.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-beat-em-jam-em-noiszy.jpg\" alt=\"Noiszy\"> <figcaption>Noiszy's homepage</figcaption> </figure> <p>Noiszy is a browser plugin that creates meaningless web data - digital noise. It visits and navigates around websites, from within your browser, leaving misleading digital footprints around the internet. It obscures you, but if enough people did it, could it actually turn Google or Facebook’s greatest asset into a giant liability.</p> <p>What if more than 51% of the data they received was nonsense generated by humans in their own name? Would it break the&nbsp;matrix and implode the universe?</p> <p>Maybe, if enough of us did it, it could actually&nbsp;inspire change. Facebook, Google and Amazon all relies on this data. They package and sell the very same data that we’re talking about obscuring. Maybe we could expose the&nbsp;system with the very same clicks, likes and shares that they crave.</p> <p><strong>The positive version</strong></p> <p>When explaining this idea to people I often get the feedback that \"I wouldn't want that because it would make the suggestions I get worse and ruin my feeds\". That's an interesting observation given that the main reason for the tech giants programming their recommendation systems the way they have is not for your benefit, but rather by viewing your attention as a resource to extract and sell. But despite this initial objection, I felt compelled to also include the positive version of my proposed digital activism.</p> <p>We could also use these data generation techniques for our own personal good. A friend of mine keeps two YouTube accounts. One of them is only used for Ted talks, stuff for work and other things that represents his best self. On the other one he watches football highlights, music, gaming and other entertainment. But he won’t let that “pollute” his other account because then it instantly takes over and dominates. Recommender systems often crave the easiest fix, that's how their masters trained them. Being in the world of recommender systems that made me think.</p> <p>If we can build systems to obscure data, we could also build bots that can train these algorithms to show us more of what we’d like, not more of who we are. Until my YouTube account has an “exploration” setting I can switch on, I might employ a bot to be more aspirational on my behalf - so to speak. If left to themselves, these algorithms <a href=\"http://nxhx.org/maximizing/\" target=\"_blank\">maximize engagement</a> and time spent, but is that really what we want?</p> <p>Maybe digital activism is just a first step.&nbsp;We could employ bots to make sure our YouTube and Instagram feed stays balanced, even if that content is not always our first impulsive choice. Maybe if we hid our worst tendencies from ourselves, then actually&nbsp;getting value from all the amazing content on these platforms would be easier too.</p> <p>I’d pay 3.99 a month for that.</p>",

In <a href=\"/blog/present-future-publishing-media-moments-2018\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">part one</a> we looked at the Media Moments 2018 report by Media Voices, and in this part we’ll be looking at Pete Wootton’s talk about how Dennis Publishing is projected to make 40% of its revenue from e-commerce in 2018.</span></p> <p>Pete Wootton is Chief Digital Officer of Dennis Publishing, and his talk was about <a href=\"https://www.buyacar.co.uk/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyaCar</a>, the e-commerce platform which is pointing the way forward for publishers looking to diversify their revenue streams. He started by talking a little about Dennis’ business as a whole. Dennis has turnover of around 170 million pounds, and operates in the U.K. and the U.S.. The business is based on four publishing verticals, or pillars: automotive, technology, lifestyle and current affairs. Their biggest brand is The Week a well-known current affairs title. What fewer people now is that they’re also very big in the automotive space.</p> <h2>Dennis’ Digital Strategy</h2> <p>Pete prefaced the main part of the presentation by setting out the three key parts of Dennis’ digital strategy. Firstly, the primary focus is to build audiences in their key verticals. The vertical market piece is really important, because general online audiences have been quite commoditized. If you can build an audience in a specific sector, particularly one where users are likely to be interested in making a purchase, then it's easier to monetize them (and in a variety of ways). They're much more valuable than a generic audience in a vertical like current affairs, for example.</p> <p>Secondly, Dennis have set out to launch a lot of new digital products. They publish a portfolio of 15 different media sites and one e-commerce business, and of those over half of them have been launched in the last few years. It's not just about taking a traditional print brand like The Week and turning it into a website. It's about imagining completely new products online to make sure they're optimizing the opportunities to monetize users across their digital portfolio.</p> <p>The third and final part of their digital strategy is about diversifying revenue streams. Pete referred back to the Media Moments 2018 presentation, where Peter Houston had already referred to the need for a ‘mix of six’ revenue streams. Pete repeated that you can't just rely on display advertising. Dennis do very well out of display, but it's crucial to find other ways to monetize your audience as well.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S05.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <h2>BuyaCar.co.uk</h2> <p>BuyaCar is the main reason that Dennis has been so successful in diversifying their revenues. As e-commerce sites are getting into content, Dennis, as a content business, is going the other way, getting into e-commerce. It's an unusual story for a media business, but potentially a sign of things to come. For people who haven’t heard of it, BuyaCar is the market leading platform for purchasing and financing a used car online. It’s a completely end-to-end service: you click ‘buy’, and the car is delivered to your door. It’s unique, and there’s quite a lot going on behind the scenes. Pete went on to describe the process.</p> <p>BuyaCar gets its cars from franchise dealers (it's nearly always franchise dealers, because they have the best quality stock), so first of all they have to agree deals with them. Each dealer has a stock feed of perhaps 500-10,000 cars, which BuyaCar then list on their site and promote to their in-network audience of car buyers. The aim is to get an audience member, either directly through BuyaCar or through one of Dennis’ automotive properties, to convert and put a deposit down for a car. One a deposit has been made, BuyaCar reserve the car with the dealer. Because they don't reserve a car until they've got an order from a customer, they avoid the liabilities associated with holding stock. When someone buys a car, they need to insure it, finance it, and perhaps choose a warranty, so BuyaCar also try and sell those options to the customer. It’s only once the purchase is confirmed that BuyaCar actually buy the vehicle. On the same day, usually, they get a payout from the finance company, the consumer pays their deposit, and then BuyaCar pay the dealer. It happens essentially simultaneously. Then BuyaCar send a delivery driver to the dealer to pick up the car and deliver it to the customer.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S08.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <h2>Why buy BuyaCar?</h2> <p>The first question that Pete asked himself when Dennis were debating the purchase was whether people would really buy a used car, sight unseen, on the internet. It’s understandable that people might be skeptical, but it works. Dennis were taking a risk when they bought BuyaCar, but it was a calculated one, with a number of factors influencing them to go ahead.</p> <p>Firstly, Dennis is a leading player in the automotive publishing sector, which means they’re trying to build audiences from people who want to buy a car. They commissioned some independent research, and found that readers of Auto Express and Car Buyer, which are their two biggest motoring brands, were 74 percent more likely to configure a car on a manufacturer site, and 50 percent more likely to book a test drive, than standard traffic. These aren’t just people who are interested in cars: these are people who are ready to convert. Buying BuyaCar meant acquiring a ready-made channel to monetise that inclination to convert that Dennis’ audience already had.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S09.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>If you're in the market for a car in the UK and you're researching online, which is a lot of people these days, then there’s a good chance you’ll come to one of Dennis’ sites at some point. They’ve done a great job of getting in front of engaged audiences. About one in five pounds which is spent on display-ad spend in the motoring sector is spent with Dennis at the moment, but how do they make sure that that’s sustainable revenue? Pete showed the audience an old screengrab from Car Buyer, one of Dennis’ sites. It had a high level of display advertising, which is one of the factors that leads to ad blocking and turns consumers off. He admitted that it wasn’t a good user experience, and it’s not a viable long-term strategy. BuyaCar is one of the solutions to that, and that was the second factor influencing the purchase: with BuyaCar, Dennis can put e-commerce opportunities directly in front of people they know are interested in the product, in a way that doesn’t compromise the experience at all. In fact, connecting people to truly relevant purchase opportunities makes it better.</p> <p>To illustrate how it works, Pete showed the audience a screenshot of media brand Autoexpress. It has a few million unique users a month looking at car content. Dennis have an API which pulls in the latest cars from BuyaCar. E.g. at the bottom of a Volvo V40 review page they pull in the latest related cars that they've got available into a widget which then links straight through to BuyaCar. They're using media assets directly to get their audience in front of BuyaCar e-commerce opportunities and get conversions into car sales.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S17.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>The final factor in the decision to purchase BuyaCar was the hunch that Dennis had that online car-buying was going to take off. Dennis did a lot of consumer research before they bought BuyaCar, and it showed in 2013 that not many people would be confident buying a car online: 17.5% of them. A big change in attitudes was required. Despite this, Dennis were sure that the trend was going upwards. Sure enough, they repeated the same research in September last year – the figure was 35.5%. This is backed up by all the other evidence in the market, and the trend is now very positive. One of the big reasons for that is the changing demographic of car buyers. Today's car buyers are increasingly the millennial generation. They're used to doing everything online, and not only online, but also on a smartphone. That applies to buying cars too. Pete asked why anyone would expect that people are going to suddenly go back to buying cars from dealerships in the future?</p> <p>Pete said that he felt that the physical experience of going to a used-car dealership can be quite patronizing and intimidating, and he sees that as part of the reason why people are getting more relaxed about buying cars online. He thinks that female users will become an increasingly large part of their audience demographic, and it was a deliberate tactic to make the site gender neutral. Their customers are over-indexed to a younger demographic and female, but that’s not surprising.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S10.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>Some other interesting data are the average distance somebody will go to buy a vehicle. The reason why Autotrader ask you to put your postcode in straight away when you land on the site is that the next thing you do is specify that you want to search for cars within a certain distance; nearly everybody searches within a 50 mile radius from their postcode. Unsurprisingly, most people won't drive more than 30 miles to go and see a Ford Focus. It’s another advantage for BuyaCar, because their cars are delivered directly to consumers. However, because people expect to be asked their postcode on a car buying site, it actually created friction for BuyaCar that they couldn’t. People were confused when they couldn’t find the option to enter their postcode. So, if you try and enter your postcode on BuyaCar, a little modal appears which says \"good news you haven't got to put a postcode in because we're a completely end-to-end online platform... act quickly in order to secure a car\". It’s a new and, so far, unique way of doing things.</p> <h2>Transforming BuyaCar</h2> <p>When Dennis bought BuyaCar it was a very small business. There were five employees, including the two founders, and the site was very basic and certainly not responsive or optimized for mobile. Since then it’s been completely replatformed, and is now very mobile friendly, which is important because over half of traffic comes from mobile. It's also a very scalable platform that allows for multi-variate testing, and it’s put them in a good position for the growth of the business in the future, which is crucial: they’ve just taken on their 65th person. That’s a lot of growth in four years, and at the current trajectory, they’re already looking at hiring potentially another 40 people next year.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S12.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>The business is now consistently delivering over 400 cars a month. Pete said that sometimes it's easy to forget that Dennis is a media company. They produce magazines and websites, and they’re physically selling 400 cars per month to consumers all across the country. It’s also crucial that they have other ancillary revenue streams form the business: they’re providing over £4,000,000 per month in car financing, and they make over six figures a month just in commission from that finance. Pete said that it was quite an eye-opener when he realized how much money there was in the industry. They also sell warranties, which are another high margin product.</p> <p>There’s also been really good growth in user interaction. One of BuyaCar’s KPIs is directly linked to collecting data by getting people to fill out forms. Providing a quote for a used car is really just data gathering for them. In order to get a quote a user has to put in their name, address, email address, and hopefully phone number. The user can then go straight into a nurturing process of automated emails and telephone calls to try and get them to convert. It’s data that makes it possible to nurture and convert someone.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S19.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>With this in mind, one of the key ways that Dennis leverage their media properties is to gather data that allows them to make e-commerce more effective. They’ve done a lot of work to build traffic to their automotive properties through their content strategy, which is almost entirely organic. They spend virtually no money on marketing. The only marketing budget for 2018 has been a few hundred pounds a month on brand protection PPC. The benefit of an effective organic content strategy is that it generates an audience that they know is more likely to convert.</p> <p>Pete talked about other ways that they’ve improved the business, saying that, in the past, BuyaCar maybe hadn’t always given the best customer service. BuyaCar don't actually see the vehicle prior to delivery; they only see the pictures and the information the consumer does, and an outsourced delivery driver picks it up. Sometimes there are quality control issues, and they’re not in control of that, but what they are in control of is what happens to the consumer when it happens. They’ve made dealing with any complaints or unsatisfactory purchases a top priority.</p> <p>The result of all of this work and growth is that BuyaCar has been staggeringly successful for Dennis. It's predicted to provide about 40% of the company’s turnover this year, roughly £62 million, which is even more impressive bearing in mind it was £400,000 when they bought the business. Orders are up significantly, and probably just as importantly, 90 percent of all sales include financing. Pete thinks that that turnover could climb to 4-500 million in the next few years.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S23.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <h2>Where does it go from here?</h2> <p>Looking to the future, they’re focusing on three main areas: customer acquisition, above-the-line advertising and improving conversion. With above-the-line advertising the plan is to experiment with radio and TV. They can certainly envision BuyaCar being a big consumer brand. When it comes to conversions, one example of something that they’re looking to improve is delivery time. The longer the time between somebody placing an order and getting a car delivered, the more likely they are to cancel. Part of the reason is that users don't stop looking for a car after they’ve ordered one, and the deposit is fully refundable. If a user goes down to their local dealer and the dealer has a very similar car to the one that the user has just ordered, and they can have it that day, then people can get buyer's remorse and cancel. So by speeding up delivery they can really improve here.</p> <p>There are also more major plans in the works which they haven’t begun to put into action yet. One thing that they’re thinking about is whether or not it's a product that they can license into other territories. The reason the licence is valuable is that there’s lots of knowhow in running a business like BuyaCar. It’s very hard to just clone the platform. For example, what’s the best process for onboarding a new dealer? It’s not just building a nice-looking website, there’s also lots of operational complexity.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dennis-2018_11-S25.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Publishing\"></figure> <p>Pete ended by repeating the point about the importance of diversifying revenue streams. Not only has Dennis done that successfully, but Pete feels that they’re also revolutionizing the way people buy new and used cars in the UK. Not bad for a publishing company.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>On 13 November 2018, Bibblio, with Media Voices, What’s New In Publishing and Sovrn Holdings put on ‘The Present &amp; Future of Publishing’, an event exploring key industry developments in 2018, and a look forward to what will be making headlines in 2019. Here's some of what we learnt.</p> <!--more--> <p><span>With so much covered, it would be impossible to sum up everything in one recap, but in this part we’ll be looking at the presentation of the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"http://info.sovrn.com.pages.services/media-moments-2018-report/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Media Moments 2018 report</a><span>.&nbsp;</span>The report, produced by Media Voices for What’s New In Publishing, explores seven key areas which have influenced the media and publishing industry this year, from reader revenue and platforms to advertizing and data. It finishes with a look at some of the key opportunities for 2019. There to introduce it on the night were the team behind Media Voices, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismsutcliffe?lang=en\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Sutcliffe</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Flipping_Pages?lang=en\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Houston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EstherKeziaT?lang=en\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Esther Kezia Thorpe</a>, who delved into some of the key takeaways from the report.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S02.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>Chris started by exploring the stark reality of the Duopoly (Facebook and Google, for anyone not haunted by the term) and the effect that their control of the vast majority of ad spend has on publishers. It’s something that worries the industry, unsurprisingly, but he argued that things can change very quickly. Amazon has shown that new entrants really can muscle their way into the space. It was probably inevitable that they would try, since 90% of Amazon searches end with a purchase, and that’s a place advertizers want to be. Chris conceded that that doesn’t necessarily create a lot of hope for publishers, but it does show that the landscape isn’t immutable. Things will continue to change and there’s room for innovation. This year, ad alliances have sprung into being, Buymedia has expanded beyond Belgium and there have been other unexpected developments. Chris’ message was that as much as it can feel like publishers need to hop into bed with Google and Facebook to be successful, that’s not necessarily true. Things are always in flux, and there isn’t just one path to success.</p> <p>Peter Houston took up the theme of how power has been concentrated in what we should perhaps think of now as the ‘Trioploy’, given the nature of Amazon. As the Triopoly hoover up ad revenues, many publishers have started looking to reader revenues. That’s subscriptions, digital subscriptions, memberships – taking money directly from readers for content. A couple of years ago there was a ‘pivot to paywalls’, and now that that has settled down a bit, people are starting to care more about how to actually retain readers. Churn in consumer magazines is somewhere around 30%, and it’s 4-5x cheaper to retain subscribers than it is to acquire new ones according to research by the FT. That’s a powerful incentive to work on retention.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S03.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>It’s even more important than those figures make it sound, because consumers are going to start making choices. People won’t just keep adding subscription after subscription after subscription. If you’re going to avoid churn, it’s essential that you deliver on your promises. Publishers are recognizing that, and there’s a lot of work going on around engagement and personalization, more with the aim of keeping people than finding new people.</p> <p>Esther discussed the platforms, aiming to keep the focus quite narrowly on what has affected publishers, since to write about everything would have taken a book, not a chapter. One thing that really stood out to her was that 44% of 18-27 year olds in the US have deleted their Facebook app. Facebook has had problems. According to a recently released report, it’s the least trusted social platform. Growth has also plateaued in the western markets, which are the most valuable. But, Facebook owns Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, and none of them are having any problems with growth at all. It remains to be seen what will happen in 2019.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S04.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>Next, Peter brought up commodity print. He said it’s take an absolute kicking. In the last ABC report, women’s weeklies have seen a fall in circulation of 40%. Being in commoditised, undifferentiated print is not a good place to be. On the other hand, if you have a very specific point of view that people value, you can do very well. The Spectator is a case in point, with good growth and their biggest year ever, selling 65,000 copies between subscription and newsstand. The editor, Fraser Nelson, said that it was digital that drove that growth, specifically a web trial publicized in newsletters. The Week Junior, a current affairs magazine for children, has grown 30%. These are the sorts of things that are winning in print, and it seems like it’s coming from digital and print working together. Finally, print and digital are helping each other out.</p> <p>The next topic was trust in the media, which Chris introduced. He said it’s been a bugbear of his for a while, and he feels like this was the year that issues with trust in the media really came home to roost. He was particularly alarmed by the way that some politicians seem to be trying to exploit distrust of the media for their own ends. It’s not just distrust. He said that 1 in 5 people now just ignore the news completely. That’s not people being ignorant of the news, it’s people making a deliberate choice to avoid it. This is a problem, because trust is really the base success metric for news media. This year particularly, where we saw so many issues around the media more generally: falling advertizing revenue, inability to convert people to paying subscribers, really biting, the idea that people don't trust the news anymore is particularly troubling.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S06.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>As depressing as that is, there are a few real causes for hope. People do tend to trust public media, like the BBC, a lot more than they do private media. People tend to trust their own local sources of news a lot more than they do the national news. So Chris sees real green shoots here. Because trust in media is the basis on which people buy news - they won't buy news from sources that they don't trust - you do get the sense that the local media, as relatively under-resourced as they are, will be able to find their footing again. What’s more, despite the problems, some news organizations are basically building a business model on the fact that people trust them. For example what The Guardian is doing with its membership scheme, what The Atlantic's doing with The Masthead, what Quartz is doing (today they announced that they're launching a new memberships section). You can see that there is a business model as long as you have that trusted relationship with an audience. So there’s hope.</p> <p>Peter Houston carried on with the theme of business models. He talked about one of his heroes, David Carey, who ran Hearst Magazines for years. About a decade ago David Carey said: you need five or six revenue streams to run a publishing business. This year, Reuters did a digital leadership survey, and guess what they said: you need five or six revenue streams to run a publishing company. Advertizing and subscriptions, or reader revenues, are two of those, you can perhaps add events and e-commerce too, and then it's up to you. The question of how are you going to structure these alternative revenue streams is the most interesting part. It's all about adding value. Just throwing stuff out there and hoping that people will pay for it is done. You could create an archive model like Esquire, then sell a subscription directly to that archive. You could create books out of your recipes, like allrecipes.com did. You could offer consultancy services, like some of the B2B publishers do, or talk directly to the readers and giving them advice about the markets they're in. You have to figure out what adds value to your audience. If you can get that ‘mix of six’ going, then you've got a sustainable business. If you’re just looking at digital display, or even print display, you're in trouble.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S07.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>Esther mentioned GDPR as well, and the problems it’s caused for European consumers trying to access US sites, but the main thing for publishers to be aware of, perhaps, is the fact that the US is contemplating their own GDPR-style rules. Things could get interesting.</p> <p>Chris finished things off on a positive note, announcing to the audience that 40 percent of Slate's revenue will come from podcasting this year: those aren’t incidental numbers anymore. Slate's sister company, Panoply, are going solely into the provision side of podcasting, e.g. advertizing and programmatic. Chris said that what this stat proves, more than anything, is that there is room for growth in the amount of content that we consume. New touch points like podcasts give publishers new ways to reach their audience: there is a huge opportunity there. It’s not just podcasts - you only have to look at what Vox is doing on Netflix with its explained series - what the FT is doing with VR, essentially virtual reality programmatic.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S09.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure> <p>There are opportunities here for publishers to reach audiences on these new channels, and as Peter mentioned with that 'mix of six', you can’t rely on one or two revenue channels, especially bigger publishers. A lot of that ‘mix of six’ is going to be coming in from these new sources of revenue, whether that's podcasting, video, partnerships with platforms, or something else.</p> <p>Chris said that they wanted to end the report with hopeful thought: publishers won't necessarily be able to rely entirely on advertizing or subscriptions anymore, but if you can reach an audience with content that really matters to them then you do have a great business model. Slate and Panoply are a great case in point, with podcasting. There’s a real sense of hope among publishers who are investing in these new ways of reaching audiences: a sense that they'll be able to thrive, and they’re not just running down the clock like a lot of print newspapers in the UK are. They're actually going out, finding and reaching new audiences. <br><br>Some of these points aren’t necessarily revelatory – people have said them before – but 2018 was the year where we saw them go mainstream. That’s a great source of hope.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mediamoments-2018_11-S10.jpg\" alt=\"Media Moments 2018\"></figure>",

    "post_content": "<p>From v.1 and choosing which data to use, to incremental improvements, learn all about how Elsevier built their research article recommender system.</p> <!--more--> <p>On 8th November 2018, Bibblio held the 7th RecSys London at Elsevier’s offices on London Wall, welcoming a great group of speakers and guests to explore the world of Recommender Systems. Our first talk, from Maya Hristakeva at Elsevier, was ‘Beyond Collaborative Filtering: Learning to Rank Research Articles’, and we’ve brought you a really detailed look at what she said, <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-11-08-RecSysLDN-Elsevier.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">together with her slides</a>.</p> <p>Elsevier is a global information analytics company, with digital products like ScienceDirect, Mendeley, Scopus and Evise. Their users, mainly researchers, academics and health professionals, don’t just need to keep up to date with research: they need to find places to publish, they need to find funding, they need to find people to collaborate with, and their editors need to find people to review their work. Elsevier has developed products to serve these use cases, and the recommender systems team help with all of them, as well as with the more conventional content use cases.</p> <h2>Recommender systems at Elsevier</h2> <p>The recommender team at Elsevier has a mix of data scientists, data engineers and product people, and they work quite closely together to build the products. Maya is in charge of the data scientists. She provided us with an overview of the kind of recommender systems they build, and took a deeper dive into the related article recommender that they’ve built for ScienceDirect.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S09.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>ScienceDirect, has about 15 million articles – all of Elsevier’s content. Creating good tools to navigate such a large amount of content is crucial. As well as suggesting relevant content, Elsevier are also looking to create personalized experiences. Elsevier provide two different degrees of personalization, which to some extent are based on different types of data, e.g. a different balance of content and usage data. They have a lot of different data, and part of the decision-making process is deciding how to use which of that data to make for a more effective product.</p> <p>As well as 15 million articles, ScienceDirect gets about 14 million monthly visitors. Not every user is required to log in, e.g. if you have institutional credentials that gives you the right to access to the content. So, they have a combination of logged-in activity and also anonymous logged-out activity, although for the logged-out activity they do have the concept of sessions, and they know what the user has done in that session.</p> <h2>Building the ScienceDirect article recommender</h2> <p>When they started working on the article recommender project, they had a huge amount of usage data for the platform, as well as a number of other data sources that they have from other Elsevier platforms. One thing that they’ve discovered generally from building recommender systems is that collaborative filtering works a lot better than content-based filtering when rich usage data is available. That’s unlikely to come as a surprise to anyone, as a lot has been published on the subject.</p> <p>Also unsurprisingly, there can be a cold start problem with collaborative filtering algorithms – e.g. what do you do with new articles where there is no usage data. The recommender team have fallback solutions built on content-based filtering, but they find that as little as a few weeks of usage data is enough for them to use collaborative filtering. Users also come to the platform from external sources such as Google or Twitter, so it’s not as if people are only finding articles via the recommender system.</p> <p>The first iteration of v.1 of the recommender used data from the browsing logs, i.e. what the user has browsed in a session. They used item-to-item collaborative filtering, and then the article content as business logic for filtering, e.g. based on recency or article type. People often request recent content, but one important aspect of research articles is that they don't really go out of fashion, so they need to stay discoverable. Maya said that she wouldn’t drill down too much on item-based collaborative filtering, as it’s a system that most people in the audience were likely to be familiar with.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S13.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>For one of the aims of the system, to try and recommend articles that are similar to ones that users have already browsed, they use item-based nearest neighbor collaborative filtering. They’ve found that cosine similarity works the best as a metric for judging similarity. The nearest neighbor collaborative filter can be user-based for some of the more personalized setups, or item-based for the setups that are more focused on article similarity. The approach gives good results: it scales quite well, and it's relatively simple to implement. They do have their own in-house Spark Scala library for nearest neighbour collaborative filtering, and that scales well for them.</p> <p>Maya said that they have the data available from all of Elsevier’s different products to train the algorithms, but all of the different products require a nuanced approach because the use case they're trying to solve, and the user experience they're trying to create, is always slightly different. For the ScienceDirect article recommender, they use a lot of the platform usage data, but they also bring in data from Scopus and from Mendeley. On the Mendeley platform, they use a lot of the usage data from Mendeley, but also bring in Scopus reputation data, and they sometimes enrich it with usage data from ScienceDirect as well. How they combine data really depends on the effect they’re trying to achieve for users, and users differ between platforms, even if there’s overlap.</p> <p>When it comes to choosing the algorithms that they use for other platforms, the approach is always data-led. It really depends on the available data and use case (or user need) they are trying to address. Sometimes they use content-based solutions. On Mendeley they use user-based collaborative filtering algorithms. They do have libraries though, e.g. a collaborative filtering library that scales. So, when they set up an offline evaluation they go through a couple iterations of different algorithms and approaches to test and benchmark them, and then they narrow it down from there, and eventually A/B test. In terms of retraining the algorithms, they retrain the collaborative filtering ones about once a day, and they precompute the ranking models once a week.</p> <p>They place quite a bit of emphasis on evaluation, and how they can know that what they're doing is working well enough. They use the browsing logs to help with this. They do time-split evaluation to split data into a training set and a test set. So they’re using the browsing logs, but using a related article to set it up as a session-based prediction task. For example, they generate item-to-item similarities for the recommendations, and then they can set it up so that they use the first article in the session for a query, and then try to predict what the user would browse next. They find that this works well, and correlates well with online A/B tests to evaluate potential improvements to the system. Evaluation of the recommendation doesn’t end with whether or not the user engages with the content: they're starting to look at how much time the users actually spend on it, but that’s not live on the platform yet.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S15.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>Maya then discussed how they approach user inaction – i.e. how to treat recommendations that the user ignores. On ScienceDirect they don’t think about it yet, but on Mendeley Suggest they do something called impression discounting where (see this <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/research/2014/modeling-impression-discounting-in-large-scale-recommender-systems\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paper by LinkedIn</a>) you can build a model around the data from when an item’s been shown ‘n’ number of times and the user hasn't engaged with it. You begin to discount it, and eventually it could fall off the list. They are looking how to deal with user inaction, but it’s a tricky area, because you don't know whether a recommendation is being ignored because it’s bad, or good, but not now.</p> <p>For the candidate selection set, which they select the recommendations from, they have 100 or 150 items. Then they re-rank that list, and they used to show the top three to users, but now they're showing a paginated view of the top six for ScienceDirect. People rarely go beyond the first 5-10 results even when they’re shown more, although they do show more than six recommendation on other products.</p> <h2>Improvements</h2> <p>The team were looking for improvements to the v.1 of the system, and found adding significance weighting to the scores was quite effective. You take your cosine and then you multiply it or scale it down, depending on how many times the two items have co-occurred. So ‘K’ controls for that minimum number of sessions that two items could co-occur in. They find that K = 5 works quite well for them (i.e. the pair need to have co-occurred in at least five sessions for you to have full confidence in the cosine score). An alternative is to just have a hard threshold, i.e. the two things need to have co-occurred a minimum number times in order for it to be considered, but that would impact your catalogue coverage. This can work quite well in combination with some kind of other score thresholding.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S16.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>Other things they wanted to improve were scalability, performance and recommendation quality. They found that these can really be boosted by having minimal/maximal filters for the numbers of articles per session or number of sessions per article, and this can also weed out some odd things happening in the data. Because they work with research articles there is a seasonality effect in the academic year: summer, versus Christmas, versus the terms. They find that using at least a full year of data works quite well to eliminate some of these effects whilst retaining good coverage. In order to boost recency the team sometimes apply time-decay functions. They find that an exponential time-decay function on the usage data actually works well.</p> <p>The team has other data that they can use to improve the algorithms too. On ScienceDirect, in addition to the browsing logs and the content data, they also have interaction data and they know what was shown by the recommender. From Scopus platform they also have the most accurate and complete citation and coauthor data, as well as the reputation metrics. These get computed on the journal level, the article level and on the author level as well.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S18.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <h2>Learning to Rank</h2> <p>Another challenge the team took on was improving the ranking function of the recommender. It’s quite a common tactic, but they took their candidate selection, enriched it with features and then trained a form of click prediction, using learning to rank models to try to generate a better ordering for the list of recommendations offered. They use the collaborative filtering similarity score as a feature for doing that, and they extract features from the citation network, the text and the topic as well, so that they can categorize articles into topics via different taxonomies.</p> <p>They can also include temporal features. One of the main pieces of feedback from users is that they want recent content. The team’s issue is that if you always give users just recent content then you won’t necessarily get the highest engagement. The solution is a bias towards recent content rather than always selecting recent content. They’re also seeing how reputation and other metrics work as features as well.</p> <p>When you set out to train the learning to rank model, the standard set up is that you have a query document and then you have the related documents, or the associated recommended documents, and then you have relevance judgment between them, essentially. You can then explore whether the pairs that have the higher relevance ranking are actually ranking higher, or not. There are different optimization objectives that you can have: pointwise, pairwise, listwise. There are a number of different algorithms out there to do this, and a lot of different libraries. The one they've used quite successfully is RankLib. It's a Java-based learning to rank package, and since most of their services are JVM-based, it plugs in nicely with that.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S21.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>They evaluated a number of the different algorithms for the learning to rank task, and found that LambdaMART gave them the best results. In effect it combines a listwise information retrieval metric such as NDCG and decision trees to solve a listwise ranking optimization problem. In order to train the algorithm, it requires data. They looked into the recommender logs’ user engagement data – i.e. what was shown to users and what did they actually engage with (whether that’s a click or a download). That's easier said than done, sometimes. They have to work with the product teams to make sure that that required feedback data is actually recorded and sent, and it's in a form that they can actually work with. This engagement data is personal, so based on a session ID, or on your profile if you’re logged in.</p> <p>So out of the recommendations that they show, they know which ones the user engaged with, with the timestamp. They also have the request ID which basically allows them to group which content was shown together, so you can say of the ‘n’ that were shown the 3th and the 5th were the ones that the user downloaded or engaged with. If a user goes on to actually read the content then they can record the further engagement.</p> <p>To make the relevance judgement, they look at each query article, they take all of the recommended articles in all the user sessions, they count the impressions and clicks, and then they compute a graded relevance score for the label.</p> <p>One of the problems that they ran into is there's not much variance and variability in the list of possible recommendations. This makes it hard to actually learn which recommendations are the best, and also to get a good distribution throughout the corpus. So something that they’ve done, and it’s pretty lightweight to implement in an API, is dithering, something which Ted Dunning has talked about. You can&nbsp;<span><u><a href=\"https://buildingrecommenders.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/dithering/\">read Elsevier’s blog about it here</a></u></span>. It's not pure explore/exploit, the way you might think of a multi-arm bandit, but it’s a similar idea, where you take your ramp and you add a bit of noise to it, and then you shuffle the list a little bit. As you increase epsilon, epsilon gives you the amount of shuffling that you're doing, and you can shuffle the list more or less.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S26.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>The nice thing about this is it gives some freshness to the user, or the impression of freshness. It also allows the Elsevier team to do more exploration of the list, and it removes some of the bias from the feedback that they can then train these models with (although it doesn't unbias it completely). They also think about the filter bubble: it’s a big problem if everyone in the same field always sees the same articles, as it could e.g. bias the direction of research. It’s not something that they’ve been able to measure yet explicitly, though.</p> <p>Selecting the parameter which you judge the shuffling by is a trade-off to some extent. Elsevier did an offline evaluation with the session-based recommendation. The idea is to work out how much shuffling of the list causes a drop off in the quality, and by how much. They picked a point that was an appropriate trade-off between exploration and the quality. It's a click prediction task. They did a lot of analysis around position bias, but there wasn't a significant drop between the first second and third position in the recommendations offered.</p> <p>For the training model they do have a time/split evaluation, which Maya remarked is quite standard, and they have the standard training validation and test set. They ended up testing a lot of the different ranking algorithms, and different features, and did quite a bit of an exploration into the space, e.g. how much data to use. In the end, the model that seemed to perform the best did deliver a 8-10 percent improvement in user engagement when it was A/B tested.</p> <p>They also did some post hoc analysis of how learning to rank changes the recommendation list, and they noticed two particular things. Firstly, it increases journal diversity, so the recommendations in the list come from different journals, without the team having to enforce it as a specific criteria. Secondly, learning to rank promotes more recently published articles, which was something that users were asking for.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S28.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>It was also nice for them to see how they can then pull in a number of these data sets and data sources and put them into a ranking model for the team to use. One thing which still puzzles them a little bit is the relative performance of the collaborative filtering scores, the LambdaMART model and random. Random here is essentially that if they take the list of 100 that they generate and just completely shuffle it. On the click-prediction path, where you're trying to say \"well what is the user going to engage with?\", the LambdaMART model really outperforms the Collaborative Filtering Score ranker, and they're using NDCG as the metric.</p> <p>They did the same post hoc analysis on the second prediction task: they asked, how well does the algorithm do predicting what the user is going to browse next? They were looking for the path that they could use to really tune and optimize the collaborative filtering candidate (what they now call candidate selection). There, it didn't really make that much of a difference, or at least they weren’t able to comment on the statistical significance of the different results. However, after a number of A/B tests using the click prediction task, they have managed to achieve a better online performance. This is something that they're thinking about more seriously now when they set up final evaluations: what is the problem they’re actually trying to solve online? The offline recommendations should be appropriate for the online goal. The right evaluation criteria aren’t always obvious when you’re working on these problems.</p> <p>With a lot of the experiments in tuning the collaborative filtering item-based recommender, they did the session prediction and improvements in offline performance also resulted in improvement in online performance. When they worked on the click prediction task, which is taking the candidates and re-ranking them based on the recommendation click prediction, they saw that the models were improving upon collaborative filtering and random. A/B tests were seeing statistically significant improvements as well.</p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>Looking to the future, they’re examining a number of different approaches. They have three separate citation, co-author and social network graph structures, so they're looking into using random walks, or being able to explore the citation graph for candidate generation, and the co-author. They’re also looking into using deep learning, either as neural embeddings for candidate selection or using hybrid systems for ranking models.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S32.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>Maya said that one of the topics that she feels quite passionately about is evaluation. She believes that it's important that they spend a lot of time in the team talking exploring it. One element of that is correcting for bias, and another is algorithm confounding. Some other things that they're starting to look into as well are whether they should actually have a proper explore/exploit multi-arm bandit system, and whether they can use more counterfactual analysis. It may be that it’s not essential for their use case at the moment, but she thinks it would be good to be thinking slightly in advance of where they are.</p> <p>With evaluation, there is a quantitative aspect but there is also qualitative aspect. They do A/B testing, but then they also have teams that do user studies, and it all needs to come together. Dogfooding is a big thing for them, so they need to use our own products. It's a great way to get feedback. Maya said that there was a&nbsp;<span><u><a href=\"https://github.com/jeanigarcia/recsys2018-evaluation-tutorial\">really nice tutorial at RecSys about evaluation on mixed methods from Spotify</a></u></span>.</p> <h2>Challenges</h2> <p>Elsevier build recommender systems for different products, and different products have different needs, and different setups. One common challenge is how do you actually identify the users? How do you detect when users’ interests are changing, and then adapt? How much should you adapt? Should you actually take into account what they've done in the past? There's also more and more emphasis on interdisciplinary research: how do you start to connect different fields. You want to know whether you can actually start connecting the dots for users, but it's not just what's in your field, but what is also in your adjacent field and how do you use that. One example here is covering the different user needs: are you in the more exploratory mode, where you've started the new topic and you're just gathering a lot of information, or are you already an expert and just want incremental add-ons – basically keeping up to date.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-elsevier-2018_11-S35.jpg\" alt=\"Elsevier presentation at RecSys London, 8 November 2018, organized by Bibblio\"></figure> <p>Privacy and GDPR are also big topics. It's something that’s impacting the way they build the systems, and it's something that they're spending a lot of time thinking about.</p>",

Amazon Affiliates also </span><span><u><a href=\"https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/topic/t405\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recommends this plugin in its help docs</a></u></span><span>, which is a nice vote of confidence.</span></p> <p>One of the unique things about Ad Inserter is its streamlined interface. Rather than breaking everything into different sections, you can access pretty much every feature from one screen (and with no page reloads).</p> <p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GeYbGdJI0rIkvSXV-0tsfbtkDFUBrw1HJsHGZERMKylaZyLcMEYaxLqQcPzZP2-jJ1HFlX9ayCwToNkmTg_4L_-AHaNRp2o8AiiybhTfHeOFkp9s15AyOLbu8q6AtXrjLWC6tgY\" width=\"624\" height=\"564\"></p> <br> <p><span>To help you manage your ads, Ad Inserter gives you a feature called \"blocks\". A block can contain any type of ad (</span><span><em>or really any code snippet</em></span><span>). You can include:</span></p> <ul> <li><span>Google AdSense - </span><span><em>there's even a dedicated tool to help you create AdSense ads without leaving the interface</em></span></li> <li>Custom banners</li> <li>Amazon ads</li> <li>...anything</li> </ul> <p><span>You can then inject your ad blocks into a </span><span><em>ton</em></span><span> of pre-defined locations, including options like:</span></p> <ul> <li>After X paragraphs</li> <li>Before comments</li> <li>Near a specific CSS selector</li> <li>Shortcode or widget</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6nREMWmUQ8viaHN-N-y0F4zeGJD2gDmwCYKJnORSrhM6THpQnwQyo4YiilR-fMFdZlQF2VSmgGhXYWuMtwaa5fUFakYEHJ0xCKBJ0K6q3AZVQwU78OYbhuK2yP1peXpWgLtdl85n\" width=\"624\" height=\"268\"></p> <br> <p>Some of the other helpful features include:</p> <ul> <li>Ad rotation</li> <li>Ad scheduling</li> <li>Device detection/targeting</li> <li>Lots of whitelist/blacklist rules</li> <li>Adblock detection</li> </ul> <p>If you don't need to be able to sell ads directly, this is one of the best options that you'll find… and the fact that the free version will work fine for most sites certainly doesn't hurt!</p> <p>If you do need more than the free version, the Pro version is still quite affordable at just €20.</p> <h2><span>2. </span><span><u>Advanced Ads</u></span></h2> <p><span><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Ads</a> is another popular and well-rated WordPress ad plugin. It's just a little bit behind Ad Inserter, with a </span><span><strong>4.9-star rating</strong></span><span> on over 550 reviews at WordPress.org</span></p> <p>Advanced Ads can do a lot of the same things that Ad Inserter does. Two notable differences are that:</p> <ul> <li>It has a different approach to the interface - things are more spread out</li> <li>You can sell ads directly via WooCommerce</li> </ul> <p>Beyond that, it's the same general idea. You can add any type of ad to the plugin:&nbsp;</p> <p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JzPxncnwoRci5fHdt7dKruVYmmhnBVHu57x9r1fhJ1mNs2jZebHmgLa8KPpQe-OSPgv1h4uCgfwh4g0H-49d74fWqfIzAkB-Je98tPnHQkG8Y4ISpCU3BbM6TGxD5WVGb1VTg4GR\" width=\"624\" height=\"425\"></p> <p>Then, you can automatically inject those ads in a variety of locations including:</p> <ul> <li>After X paragraphs</li> <li>Via shortcode, widget, or PHP function</li> <li>At the end of your content</li> <li>Etc.</li> </ul> <p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/thuf4QVg9Q4fLn_odRv0DV7Tutr3v4hBKoGYKEm-stPYuknQRfAy_hRjGsamFpyY8Jf7p0b57qSJ5_q54E-lYtKoA8lmOlK8FPy_BKdZ_OfzoDkS8r7JHcr82x3ZKYAEizb9Bi_b\" width=\"624\" height=\"333\"></p> <br> <p>You can rotate ads according to your own weighting preferences and the plugin also tracks impressions and clicks, which is helpful for A/B testing.</p> <p>Beyond that, you also get responsive controls to change how ads behave on different devices, which is great for offering a good mobile experience.</p> <p>Finally, with the Selling Ads add-on, you can sell your ad space directly via WooCommerce. You also get the ability to create advertiser profiles where advertisers can upload ad materials by themselves.</p> <p><span>Advanced Ad's free version isn't quite as generous as Ad Inserter, but it should still work for a lot of sites. The Pro version starts at €69 and includes all 8 add-ons (</span><span><em>you can also purchase individual add-ons</em></span><span>).</span></p> <h2><span>3. AdRotate Banner Manager</span></h2> <p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/adrotate/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AdRotate Banner Manager</a> is another long-standing ad management plugin that's popular and well-rated at WordPress.org.</p> <p>As the name suggests, it does indeed let you rotate multiple advertisements. But there's also a lot more to it than that.</p> <p><span>Like Ad Inserter and Advanced Ads, AdRotate lets you create any type of ad by pasting in the code snippet. Unlike the other plugins, there aren't any different options - you just get a single </span><span><strong>AdCode</strong></span><span> box:</span></p> <p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RFImcBnnrSQLtZP9g8iazy3-M3qPchxGsAJ0k1EXRwHE7X2IHSqZLODSkSVXZPWsi3xOeoo-Jtivh6FeJde3llwTcwvI5fQhBE3oM-Q73YPkqbxX6oZKDSBSfsqW3yVW7OwftwA9\" width=\"624\" height=\"384\"></p> <p>From there, you can inject ads into your content. You can either randomly insert a banner or choose specific banners to insert. You can also set up custom weights to rotate ads according to your preferences.</p> <p>AdRotate tracks everything and gives you stats for impressions, clicks, and CTR.</p> <p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ydf0an9lBkRiCDz3Vb8pndPsxKxVh6RZoeYeLz3rhmRygTnP7Zb5r3A2pm3MKfYVz2IUosvkxtRbh6yxpWyXqecIDcvKUuqaLZgm6cDf2m0G7PBE27JBWThEL1zmUvYr8UqF0AC4\" width=\"624\" height=\"193\"></p> <p><span>One neat thing here is that you can match ads to WordPress user accounts so that you can provide people with a custom dashboard where they can view stats for </span><span><em>just their own ads</em></span><span>. Combined with a PayPal integration to accept ad payments, this is a nice solution if you want to sell ads directly.</span></p> <p>AdRotate's free version is also pretty generous. After that, the Pro version starts at €29.00.</p> <h2><span>4. WP Quads</span></h2> <p><span>Let's finish things out with one more popular and well-rated option at WordPress.org (</span><span><em>notice a trend here?!)</em></span><span>.</span></p> <p><span><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-adsense-reloaded/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WP Quads</a> is a fork of the older Quick AdSense plugin but, </span><span><em>while WP Quads definitely focuses on Google AdSense</em></span><span>, you can use it to display any type of ad, so don't feel like you're limiting yourself if you choose it.</span></p> <p>WP Quads helps you inject your ads in a variety of places, either at static positions or in random spots.</p> <br> <p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TE-6ngVpaYnMbCo8Ois_HsO7iPHnYMelMiik4WRgQjX_aBQl4Rly_tRvSbSoQ95hHaPVN7IpQCWnD9Vf7hSxG7xR4JSjxYLFkC-aBASHhHuoINVh-zdKFdhY2-LlkNHs0zL46EXa\" width=\"624\" height=\"505\"></p> <p>One area where it excels is its ability to control exactly who sees ads. First, you get responsive controls to enable/disable ads by device. But beyond that, you can also hide ads for specific:</p> <ul> <li>Post types</li> <li>User roles</li> </ul> <p>And you can also display ads on Google AMP content.</p> <p><span>If you're looking for something lightweight that's just about displaying ads, this is a good option. But it lacks some of the more advanced features like stats and direct ad sales (</span><span><em>which makes sense because of its focus on Google AdSense</em></span><span>).</span></p> <h2><span>Which WordPress Ad Management Plugin Is Right For You?</span></h2> <p><span>For most websites, the two best overall options are </span><span><u><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ad-inserter/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ad Inserter</a></u></span><span> and </span><span><u><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Ads</a></u></span><span>. The numbers reflect this, with 5-star and 4.9-star ratings respectively on a significant number of reviews.</span></p> <p>Of the two, Ad Inserter has a more streamlined and usable interface, while Advanced Ads includes that WooCommerce integration to help you sell ad space directly.</p> <p><em>Of course, there are plenty of smaller feature differences that might affect you, so you should always think about how you're planning to actually use the plugin before making a decision.</em></p> <p><span>If you are selling ad space directly, another good option could be </span><span><u><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/adrotate/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AdRotate</a></u></span><span> because it includes that neat feature that lets you create a custom reporting dashboard for individual users (</span><span><em>Advanced Ads also offers this feature</em></span><span>).</span></p> <p><span>Finally, if you're primarily focused on AdSense, </span><span><u><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-adsense-reloaded/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WP Quads</a></u></span><span> is a great option because it dispenses with all the analytics and ad sales features since you can already do all that via the AdSense interface. So if you're big into AdSense, that lightweight approach is good for you. It also </span><span><em>can</em></span><span> display other types of ads - that's just not its focus.</span></p> <p>And remember - more eyeballs equals more ad revenue. And when it comes to getting more eyeballs on your ads, displaying high-quality related content is a great way to keep people browsing your site. With our clients, we've found that quality related content suggestions can:</p> <ul> <li>Boost site engagement by 11%</li> <li><span>Increase page views by 8% (</span><span><em>that's 8% more ad impressions!</em></span><span>)</span></li> </ul> <p><span><u><a href=\"/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Head here to learn how</a></u></span><span> Bibblio's AI-powered content recommendation system can help keep your WordPress site's visitors around longer, or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts/advanced/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">download the plugin here</a>.</span></p>",

    "post_content": "<p><span>We asked the Berlin digital media and publishing community about the future of audience acquisition, and the role of diversification.</span></p> <!--more--> <p>On 26 September, Bibblio hosted the second edition of the Future of Media and Publishing meetup at Impact Hub in Berlin. As part of the evening we had a panel on audience acquisition and diversification featuring a trio of audience development executives, which enabled a really informative deep dive on the subject. So deep in fact, that there was too much for one blog post! This is Part II, and you can check out Part I <a href=\"/blog/how-can-digital-media-and-publishing-diversify-audience-acquisition\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Let's dive straight back in.</p> <h2>Syndication and cross-pollination?</h2> <p>With the disclaimer that it’s an area that Bibblio is exploring, Mads brought up the subject of syndication and cross-pollination in digital; i.e. working with other content businesses to cross-post content or share each other’s content on social. On Instagram and YouTube content creators do this a lot: they'll appear in each other's posts or videos and try to share audiences with one another. Media companies are beginning to pursue this route too: PopSugar in New York has a whole team focusing on making partnerships with other publishers and individuals. Business Insider is another good example. It’s common for them to contact a smaller publisher and offer to post one of their articles on Business Insider, but with a link back to the original article. The idea is that they get good content for free, and the publisher gets extended reach.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber02-panel2.jpg\" alt=\"Future of Media and Publishing meetup, Berlin\"> <figcaption>Panellists Deana Mrkaja from Handelsblatt, Christian Pieper from Funke Digital, and Emily Dreesen of Highsnobiety.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Emily said that Highsnobiety do have a network of partner publishers, although it’s relatively small. Business Insider was actually syndicating their content, but they haven’t seen much of an improvement in traffic (something that we’ve heard other publishers comment on). For Emily it's a cool idea to be able to leverage the power of a much bigger brand than Highsnobiety, but they’re just not seeing results in terms of referral traffic.</p> <p>What has really worked, though, is when bigger brands pick up their video content. They created a documentary on the huge culture around fake clothing in Russia, and Business of Fashion picked it up. It massively extended their reach, and the video ended up getting a million views just from Business of Fashion. So syndication in that way is great for the brand and their videos and podcasts, but it doesn’t drive much revenue from referral traffic. In response to a question about how Business of Fashion picked up the video, Emily said that she just reached out to them and suggested that they feature it.</p> <p>Mads mentioned that Bibblio actually happens to work with Business of Fashion too, and it seems to him that they’ve embraced the idea of syndication. As well as featuring content from Highsnobiety, in the way Emily described, they now have an offering called Daily, where their editors will find five or six stories from other publishers and just link to them in one place on Business of Fashion. The idea is that if you find the most interesting content there then you’ll come back, regardless of where it originated. They’re prepared to let the original publisher have the traffic, because they win too by becoming a source of interesting content.</p> <h2>Working with influencers?</h2> <p>Mads next question was whether any of the panel had tried to organize a similar syndication arrangement with a social media influencer?</p> <p>Deana said that Handelsblatt have their own take on the formula – they work a lot with famous German politicians and business personalities who write articles as contributors for the website. This helps the individual to get publicity at the same time as creating interesting content for Handelsblatt. These sorts of pieces are one of their biggest traffic sources. They do retain some control over the editorial to ensure that the content is suitable for the site.</p> <p>Mads was interested in this point because City AM in London, a popular daily commuter paper aimed at the City of London, recently opened up a commercial product where, for a fee, you can get your own editorial pass and publish content to the website without the constraints of it going through City AM’s editorial team.</p> <h2>Tourists and locals?</h2> <p>Mads mentioned the idea of tourists and locals – people who click through to your site from e.g. a social channel as opposed to people who spend time there maybe every day. He asked whether the panelists knew whether there was a difference in the revenue generated by returning visitors vs a visitor they might only see once, or very infrequently?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber02-mads-holmen.jpg\" alt=\"Moderator Mads Holmen, co-founder and CEO of Bibblio\"> <figcaption>Moderator Mads Holmen, co-founder and CEO of Bibblio</figcaption> </figure> <p>Emily said that it was hard to say for Highsnobiety, because most of their revenue comes from branded content. From a revenue point of view, it doesn't really matter if it's someone new or someone loyal that's looking at the content. She said that that doesn’t seem to be the case with ecommerce though. They know a few publishers that are really successful with e-commerce, both affiliate and own products, and the learning from talking to them is that the loyal audience is responsible for a huge part of their revenue.</p> <p>Mads said that that reflected what he’d heard at Bibblio as well there seems to be a Pareto distribution where about 20 percent of visitors generate about 80 percent of revenue (although that’s obviously a bit of a generalization).</p> <p>Mads added that that publishers are increasingly trying to exploit the potential value of these visitors. Daily Mail group now has a group of 18 staff who are dedicated affiliate writers - they only write content for the purpose of affiliate sales. He acknowledged that not all publishers will feel comfortable with this approach, but in many places it's now almost part of the normal editorial process to include commercial elements with copy.</p> <h2>Publishers need to learn from ecommerce?</h2> <p>He suggested that maybe this is just an evolution of what publishers have always been doing: writing about products and things in the world and making people want them. Isn’t it only fair that publishers start to try and take a bigger share of that revenue, if that's the value they've always created? Rather than just running banner ads and giving the users to e-commerce sites which makes all the money. Acknowledging that he was being deliberately provocative, Mads asked whether publishers should think of themselves, in some sense, as ecommerce platforms too?</p> <p>Christian agreed, saying that if publishers want to survive they have to face up to the reality of the new commercial landscape. Funke Digital has ticket shops for e.g. concerts, merchandise, and of course newspapers and books. They even have dating.</p> <p>Deana said that it’s hard for Handelsblatt to take this approach, since they have one unified, journalistic site. They have a hard paywall: all their content is behind it and you have to pay. You can’t ask users who have paid to access that content to read affiliate content. Handelsblatt would need a separate site for that sort of content. Deana agreed that on a free site affiliate content is fine, and that the audience are probably aware that that’s part of the deal when they get it for free.</p> <p>Christian added that publishers had realized that they needed to radically change their commercial models, because banners and other forms of ads weren’t generating enough revenue. In Germany a lot of publishers are switching to the subscription model.</p> <h2>Subscription and what else?</h2> <p>Mads next question was on the topic of subscription and premium products. A lot of what the publishing industry has done up until now in response to the need to find other channels for revenue is to bring in paywalls. Sometimes you can view a few bits of content before you need to pay, and some are like Handelsblatt and you have to pay straight away. Mads wanted to see what the panel thought about another approach. Should publishers think more in terms of membership, where content is free, but you get additional benefits if you pay to be part of the club? What could those things be? Perhaps better personalization, or access to events?</p> <p>Deana was very positive about events. She thinks that we have to stop trying to reach as many people as possible, and more about how to find great content for a specific audience. If you do that, people will be loyal to your brand. Good events and other exclusive perks help people to really identify themselves with your brand. Handelsblatt are trying to do a lot of events which are very exclusive and only aimed at certain groups of people.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber02-pizza.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza Zeit! Fuel for the mind and body at the Berlin meetup.\"> <figcaption>Pizza Zeit! Fuel for the mind and body at the Berlin meetup.</figcaption> </figure> <p>For the final point, Mads was curious what the panel thought about personalization. He told the story of Foodora, who had built a recommendation engine for their food delivery website to make restaurant suggestions to their users. When they implemented it, they got lots of angry feedback. The engine was recommending McDonalds and other chain restaurants a lot, and people weren’t happy. Foodora quickly discovered that this wasn’t the system malfunctioning. The system was suggesting the chains because they were popular choices that got good ratings. The trouble was, that a lot of people on Foodora didn’t want to be the ‘McDonalds person’, at least not when they were on Foodora. They didn’t want to have it suggested to them, to be labelled in that way, even if they sometimes bought McDonalds through Foodora.</p> <p>Mads suggested that maybe the lesson for publishers from this was that they should still try to appeal to the people that we would like to be, and not just the people that we are. Algorithmic personalization can trap people in narrow silos. In a world where all these other platforms, Facebook, Google etc., are personalized to us, should publishers try to do something different - something more aspirational? Is that, in the end, what people want to pay for?</p> <p>Emily had a very interesting story in response. As affiliate sales became a bigger part of Highsnobiety’s business, their strategy changed. They used to cover a lot of niche Japanese streetwear brands that you can't buy in Germany, which meant they weren’t making any affiliate revenue from those stories. So the strategy changed so that content would emphasise products that people could actually buy from the site. The result of that was lots of complaints that the site was becoming too mainstream, so they listened to their audience and returned to their more niche content.</p> <p>Emily said that, in the short run, it would have been helpful for them to continue with the more mainstream content: pop culture content is easier to monetize right away. But it doesn’t appeal to the audience that they really want. So growth is a bit slower when they don't feature ‘click bait’, but in the long run the real value is in maintaining a great brand, which means not succumbing to the lowest common denominator.</p> <p>Mads sympathized, pointing out that the Facebook publishers who really optimized click-baity content were the publishers who've been hit the hardest by far by the changes to the algorithm. Maybe there was never a shortcut to building a great publishing business.</p> <p>That's all from the second Future of Media and Publishing meetup from Berlin - join our group <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Media-Publishing-Berlin/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> to be there for the next event!</p>",

As part of the evening we had a panel on audience acquisition and diversification featuring a trio of audience development executives, which enabled a really informative deep dive on the subject. So deep in fact, that there was too much for one blog post! So this is Part I, with Part II to follow.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber02-panel.jpg\" alt=\"Moderator Mads Holmen from Bibblio, with panellists Deana Mrkaja from Handelsblatt, Christian Pieper from Funke Digital, and Emily Dreesen of Highsnobiety.\"> <figcaption>Moderator Mads Holmen from Bibblio, with panellists Deana Mrkaja from Handelsblatt, Christian Pieper from Funke Digital, and Emily Dreesen of Highsnobiety.</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Growth or diversity? Both?</h2> <p>Moderating the panel was Bibblio co-founder and CEO, Mads Holmen, and he set the scene by talking about the world publishers currently inhabit. Ten years ago, 80 percent of visitors to websites came directly: now, about 80 percent of the traffic comes from Google and Facebook. With this in mind, Mads asked the panel how important is pure audience growth versus audience diversification: i.e. is the focus just on growing page views and audience numbers, or is it on finding traffic from sources other than Google and social?</p> <p>Deana Mrkaja (Senior Audience Development Manager at Handelsblatt) began by noting that Handelsblatt is quite an unusual case. Handelsblatt’s audience is very loyal on the whole, so they’re less concerned about visitors being ‘tourists’ from social who will bounce after viewing one page. Their social traffic is actually very small - only a few percent, and often single digits. 20-30 percent is a pretty common figure she hears from other publishers.</p> <p>Diversification is still important though, and they’re focusing on opening new channels, like Instagram. However, because of the nature of the content - hard news, often about finance and economics - LinkedIn and Xing are very important to them. Her final comment was that growth is clearly crucial, but diversification is increasingly important.</p> <p>Christian Pieper (Head of Audience Development at Funke Digital) said that, these days, diversification is essential if media companies want to grow. You need to know all the sources that your audience are coming from, and how they’re behaving. Data’s not a magic bullet though - over the last few years Funke Digital has tried to identify the ‘perfect user’ for targeting purposes, and discovered that they don’t actually exist. Depending on the different user profile, they have to create different approaches and content for different platforms.</p> <p>Emily Dreesen (Head of Audience Development at Highsnobiety) agreed with Christian. She said that at Highsnobiety there was particular pressure to diversify for further growth because of the decline of Facebook traffic. As well as looking to new sources for traffic, they’re looking to improve acquisition from Google, which was easier than Facebook. They’re also focusing on the most valuable users, which for them is direct traffic. Direct is also the the hardest thing to grow. The most important element in growing direct traffic is the brand, which is also what advertisers care about the most, so developing the brand is the top priority.</p> <h2>How important is direct traffic?</h2> <p>Mads followed up by asking how much of the panelists traffic is direct at the moment, and is that measured in the company as a KPI?</p> <p>Emily said that direct traffic to Highsnobiety, especially on mobile, is quite low – single digits. That’s to be expected in the lifestyle field, because most people discover content from Facebook or Google. On desktop it's a bit higher, in the region of 10-15 percent. It’s going to become increasingly important as they look to diversify their revenue. They’re moving much more into ecommerce, and they see that the direct, super loyal users convert the best, so increasing direct visits is a top KPI.</p> <p>Christian said that for Funke Digital 40 percent of traffic is direct – the difference with Highsnobiety is to be expected because of the news category vs lifestyle. He agreed with Emily that most of the time direct traffic is coming from desktop: nobody who's using a smartphone is typing morgenpost.de into the address bar, they're using Google News and other channels.</p> <h2>Which sources are providing growth?</h2> <p>Mads asked for a quick run down of which traffic sources had been going up and which sources had been going down?</p> <p>Deana said that LinkedIn and Xing were particularly effective for them because of their niche: Handelsblatt is only really about economics and politics in Germany, so people who type in Handelsblatt.com know what they're going to get. Xing and LinkedIn are more important than Facebook and Instagram because they’re platforms suited to the topics Handelsblatt covers.</p> <p>She added that people coming to their pages are often over 60 years old, so it's not the classic Instagram demographic. They’re trying to change that though. They’re looking to reach out to younger people and find new ways to translate their content into different channels to broaden its appeal. One place they’re trying to do that is on Instagram.</p> <h2>Curating content?</h2> <p>The panel were asked about whether they curate content for certain groups, e.g. young professionals in Handelsblatt’s case?</p> <p>Deana said that Handelsblatt’s approach, which is one that a lot of other German media are taking too at the moment, is creating ‘clubs’ or running monthly events for specific audience groups. It's not about reaching millions of people, but gathering the people around you who will really stay loyal and be interested in the content that you’re creating. This is how you increase loyalty to your brand – by providing your audience with really targeted, relevant content.</p> <p>Christian was in full agreement. He suggested that everyone was talking about the impact of data, but that to get the most out of it you have to really dig into your data to look at what interests people, and try new things on new traffic sources. He makes sure that he knows which story angles and pictures are working for different user groups: the story behind the image on Instagram is the same as the story behind the headline on their web site which interests the direct user who has been coming for ten years. You need to find the right angle for each audience.</p> <h2>Channel optimization?</h2> <p>Mads asked about the process of repackaging the content for different channels. Were the panelists using any technology to do that, or are they doing what they’ve always done, but now they’re just having to do it in ten channels?</p> <p>Emily said that tried some optimization tools, e.g. translating text content into video content, but in the end they saw more success by just having a dedicated editor for each platform. Facebook pushed their Facebook Watch video platform, so they had to hire a team for that. They're now on Snapchat Discover so they’ll need to hire a team for that. In the end you still need staff for every platform - technology can’t solve that.</p> <p>Deana said that technology had had more of an impact for them. They’re using different tools for different channels, e.g. Echobox for Twitter and also for Facebook, which makes their lives much easier. E.g. with Echobox you put social media posts in the queue and it will decide when the right time to post something is. This means you have more time to do other things. But, as Emily said, you still need editors for everything, and to get the most from the tools you need to use people who really understand what they're doing. Christian echoed Deana’s thoughts. Software has more and more of a role, but it’s not bringing in automation per se.</p> <h2>Editors as social media stars?</h2> <p>Mads brought up a previous Future of Media and Publishing meetup in New York, where PopSugar and Conde Nast had talked about encouraging their own editors and journalists to build their own followings on social. The panelists acknowledged that that was something that they were doing too, so Mads asked how do they deal with those editors and journalists becoming famous in their own right? Is there a fear that in some ways they're using their brand to make them more powerful? How do they manage that internally?</p> <p>Emily said that a lot of Highsnobiety’s editors are really big on Instagram: one of them has 40000 followers. That person used to work freelance and then they owned the brand partnerships themselves. Now it always needs to be clear what's private and what's related to Highsnobiety. Editors can publish what they’d like privately, but they can’t take money from brands.</p> <p>Also, if the editorial team is in touch with brands that the branded content team are about to close big deals with, the editorial team have to be very careful that they don't just give the brand the content for free. Their editorial content is often very product focused, and they need e.g. posts on the new Nike sneakers because that's what the audience wants, so they have to work very closely with the branded team to make sure that they don't cannibalize their deals.</p> <p>That's it for Part I - keep your eyes out for Part II, coming soon!</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>Bibblio’s content recommendation plugin has a raft of&nbsp;<span>game-changing<span>&nbsp;</span></span>features designed to help online publishers. Here are 5 of the most powerful…</p> <!--more--> <h2>1. Mix a bit of popularity into your content suggestions</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Related Posts plugin</a> will always prioritize the most relevant content, based on the post you’re on, when it's choosing recommendations. This is a core principle of Bibblio’s AI, ensuring users always receive appropriate suggestions. We know that engagement is crucial to publishers too though, so you can influence which recommendations are returned by weighting them based on how popular they are with your audience. This can help to improve your page views, as your audience are more likely to engage with popular articles.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-algorithm.png\" alt=\"Weight your recommendations based on their popularity as well as relevance\"> <figcaption>Weight your recommendations based on their popularity as well as relevance</figcaption> </figure> <p>In the <strong>Modules</strong> tab of your Bibblio plugin admin, under the <i>My Modules</i> section, pick the module that you wish to be influenced by popularity. Click <strong>Module Settings</strong> in the blue bar to reveal the <i>Recommendation Type</i> panel. Set the dropdown to <strong>Improved page views</strong> and click <strong>Update</strong> in the blue bar.</p> <p>If pure relevance is more important to you, as you want the recommended posts to be suitable based on subject matter alone, you can stay on <strong>Relevance only</strong>.</p> <p>As you can set this on a module-by-module basis, you can have two modules on one post, each with different suggestions, for maximum impact. For example, you could have a <i>Relevance only</i> module row beneath your posts for those that read to the bottom and are interested in the guts of the subject, whilst on your side bar you could have an <i>Improved traffic </i>module column that draws the attention of users who are browsing with a lighter touch. Both sets of users are catered for!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>2. Recommend posts that are more recent</h2> <p>If your site has lots of content but only the most recent stuff is likely to be relevant to your audience (such as a news site), you can prioritize recency so that posts published within a chosen time span are more likely to appear as recommendations. (Older articles may still appear, but only if they're extremely relevant.)</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-recency.png\" alt=\"Alter the recency slider to prioritize newer posts\"> <figcaption>Alter the recency slider to prioritize newer posts</figcaption> </figure> <p>There is a time-based slider in the Bibblio plugin admin that sets this across all of your modules. Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, under <i>Handle Existing Posts</i> the <i>Prioritize recency</i> slider can be dragged as far back in time as <strong>two years</strong> (great for magazines, journals, travelogues etc.) or brought forward as recently as <strong>one day</strong> (for current affairs, showbiz/fashion news, latest tech etc.) and anything in between. The slider auto-saves and the changes take effect 24 hours after new items are added.</p> <p>If you do not wish to control your recommendations based on recency you can leave it set to <strong>OFF</strong>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>3. Highlight authors and the dates their posts were published</h2> <p>In addition to displaying the post title, description and <a href=\"https://www.bibblio.org/blog/making-most-images-related-posts-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">your amazing Featured Image</a> on each Related Post tile in your module, you can also show the post’s author and the date it was published.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-meta.png\" alt=\"Choose to display the post author and date\"> <figcaption>Choose to display the post author and date</figcaption> </figure> <p>If you have a team of writers who contribute to your site, and some of them have a bit of a following, mentioning their name on content recommendations could encourage users who are familiar with them to click and read on. It also injects an element of personality to your Related Posts, reminding visitors that real people are behind your stories, creating connections between writer and reader.</p> <p>By mentioning the date published, the user can also see more easily if they think that the post will be relevant to them.</p> <p>To switch the author or date display on, go to the <strong>Modules</strong> tab of your Bibblio plugin admin, under the <i>My Modules</i> section, pick the module that you wish to edit. In the <i>Display Options </i>panel toggle <strong>Display author</strong> and <strong>Display date</strong> on and off.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>4. Make the module look and feel at home on your site</h2> <p>Our default 'out-of-the-box' related posts module looks great, if we do say so ourselves, and fits into the majority of websites nicely. The clean Arial font sits on top of each Featured Image with a dark gradient to ensure legibility. You can click <strong>Separate text</strong> in the <i>Display Options</i> panel of the module editor to have the text appear on a white background too.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-separate.png\" alt=\"Display the text on a white background with your Featured Image just above it\"> <figcaption>Display the text on a white background with your Featured Image just above it</figcaption> </figure> <p>You can also change the font and text size of the titles by choosing from dropdowns of system fonts and several pre-set sizes in the <i>Headline Style</i> panel of the module editor. These system fonts are the ones most likely to be installed as standard on recent Windows and Apple operating systems, so you can be sure how your module will look across different platforms.</p> <p>However, we realise that you might have your own specific font that you use for headlines across your site which you would prefer to use instead. This can be easily applied by adding some CSS to one of your pre-existing stylesheets or by creating a new one. Be sure your stylesheet loads after the Related Posts plugin’s stylesheet (bib-related-content.css) so that it overwrites the plugin’s default class properly.</p> <p>For example, we at Bibblio use the font <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Roboto</a>. We can make our related posts module display it’s headlines in this font using the following class to override the defaults:</p> <pre>.bib__title { font-family: \"Roboto\" !important; }</pre> <p>The !important rule can be used to be sure this font overrides any properties that have preceded it. Don't forget that this font change is for the headline within a related post tile only and does not change the font used for the author, date or description. This is considered body text and is kept as Arial to guarantee legibility. You can of course override this too - we would suggest a simple sans-serif font for clarity.</p> <p>In fact, use your stylesheet to override anything you like. Using <i>Separate text</i> but have a grey page background? Change the white panels the text sits on to grey by targeting the .bib__info class. Want curved corners on each tile to match the rest of your site? Use the border-radius property in the .bib__link class. Anything is possible!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>5. Understand what works</h2> <p>The journey doesn’t end the moment you put your modules on your posts. You can use your Bibblio dashboard to monitor the effectiveness of your plugin. It allows you to see how many times a module has appeared on your post (we call these recommendation calls), how many times a related post has been clicked and the click-through rate (CTR).</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-ctr.png\" alt=\"The two click-through rates\"> <figcaption>The two click-through rates</figcaption> </figure> <p>The CTR is the ratio of users who click on a related post, compared to the number of times a module has appeared on a page. A lot of sites use CTR to measure how well the elements of their page are performing. If they find the CTR is too low (typically under the industry benchmark of 0.5-1%) they might move the element to another part of the page to improve the percentage. This is why it’s important to put yourself in the user’s shoes and consider at which point in your page would a user want to receive suggestions to related content, and insert your modules accordingly.</p> <p>Additionally, some users might not scroll through your post and ever reach your module, but if they did they might be inspired to explore more content. So, although CTR is an industry standard it is a bit of a blunt instrument, since you can’t be sure that those who didn’t click on your related posts even saw the module in the first place!</p> <p>This is why we also include in-view CTR in our dashboard. In-view CTR is the ratio of users who click on a related post, compared to the number of times people <i>saw</i> the related posts module. This shows whether or not the module is doing it’s job in enticing users to click around your site from one relevant post to another. The in-view CTR therefore tends to be higher, as it refers to engaged users - a much more accurate reflection of how the module is performing.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-plugin-ways-tracking.png\" alt=\"Add tracking parameters to your module links\"> <figcaption>Add tracking parameters to your module links</figcaption> </figure> <p>You can also track your click performance precisely by adding your own analytics parameters to the links in your module. This is useful if you want Google Analytics etc. to report this activity. In the <strong>Modules</strong> tab of your Bibblio plugin admin, under the <i>My Modules</i> section, pick the module that you wish to be tracked. Click on the <strong>Module Settings</strong> button. Under <i>Manage Tracking</i>, click <strong>Add new tracking parameter</strong> and assign a name and value (such as a utm_source or the type/location of the module). Do this for as many parameters as you want. When done, be sure to click <strong>Update</strong>. You can then set up campaigns in Google Analytics to monitor your related posts traffic.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>If you grab&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Related Posts for WordPress by Bibblio</i></a> from the plugin store, running with it out of the box will be simple and effective. You will see continuously improving, relevant content suggestions thanks to the same AI tech that’s used by big players such as Netflix and Spotify. You’ll also see&nbsp;<span>a more engaged audience and</span> improvements in your page views.</p> <p>There are plenty of ways to go further in making sure that your module looks and performs at it’s best though. These five methods will take your related posts modules to the next level. Try them out and <a href=\"/wp-contact\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">let us know</a> how you get on. We love hearing the stories we receive from sites that have super-charged their posts!</p>",

    "post_date": "25-Oct-2018 08:47:15",
    "post_content": "<p>As early as mid-November, the way that you create content with your WordPress site is going to drastically change with the release of WordPress 5.0.</p> <!--more--> <p>The focus of this major release is the WordPress Gutenberg Editor, which is a <strong>complete relaunch of the current text editor</strong> that you use to create posts and pages.</p> <p>It's not just a redesign - <strong>Gutenberg will change your WordPress content creation experience at a fundamental level</strong>, which is why it's essential that you understand how Gutenberg works to avoid any interruptions to your WordPress workflows.</p> <p>While Gutenberg will require some adjustment in the short-term, the long-term effect is that you'll gain the ability to create more engaging content for your readers. As creators of an <a href=\"/wordpress\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">engagement-boosting related content tool</a>, that's definitely something we can get behind!</p> <p>To help make the transition to Gutenberg as painless as possible for you, we created this comprehensive WordPress Gutenberg Editor guide.</p> <p>First, we'll share a brief introduction to how the WordPress Gutenberg Editor works and what it's changing. Then, we'll show you hands-on how you can effectively use Gutenberg to create content.</p> <h2>What's different about the WordPress Gutenberg editor?</h2> <p>The biggest change with Gutenberg is its new block-based editing approach. To explain <strong>block-based editing</strong>, let's first take things back to the current text editor.</p> <p>The current text editor is a lot like a Microsoft Word document. It's one single unified field where you add your text, images, and any other content. You have one toolbar at the top, and that's where you do all of your formatting.</p> <p>Here's what the introduction to this post looks like in the current WordPress Editor:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-1.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Gutenberg changes this approach by separating every element in your post into its own block (<em>sort of like the <a href=\"https://medium.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Medium editor</a></em>).</p> <p>Now, each paragraph is its own block, each image is its own block, each video is its own block...you get the idea.</p> <p>Similarly, as third-party developers start adding Gutenberg compatibility, content from your plugins will also get its own block. For example, our roadmap includes a dedicated Bibblio Gutenberg block that will let you insert related posts from Bibblio as their own block.</p> <p>So what does Gutenberg look like with separate blocks? Here's what that same content looks like in Gutenberg:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-2.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>If you want to experience this block-based approach in action, you can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">live Gutenberg demo at WordPress.org</a>.</p> <h3>What are the benefits of Gutenberg and block-based editing?</h3> <p>So why is using blocks like this better? Well, there are a few ways in which this new block-based approach is going to unlock new functionality for you.</p> <ul> <li><strong>A more visual experience.</strong> While editing, you'll be able to see how blocks will actually look to your visitors, which offers a much more visual design experience.</li> <li><strong>Easier to work with plugin output.</strong> Rather than using shortcodes to insert plugin content, plugin developers will be able to create their own visual blocks that you can use in your designs.</li> <li><strong>More layout and content flexibility.</strong> Gutenberg includes blocks that let you add new content (like a button) or create more complicated layouts (like columns) without the need for any custom HTML.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, on a more technical level, the Gutenberg Editor is built with React. This will allow third-party WordPress developers to use more modern technologies, which the current text editor doesn't allow for.</p> <h3>Rapid-fire rundown of important Gutenberg facts</h3> <ul> <li>Gutenberg is scheduled to be released as part of WordPress 5.0 around <strong>November 19th, 2018</strong>, but that <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/proposed-wordpress-5-0-scope-and-schedule/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">could be pushed back</a> as late as January 2019 depending on how the testing goes.</li> <li><strong>Gutenberg will work with any WordPress theme</strong>, but theme developers can add special compatibility for things like block styling and full-width image alignments, so you will see the term \"Gutenberg-compatible theme\" marketed soon.</li> <li><strong>All your existing content will use Gutenberg as well</strong>, but in a special way. We'll show you how it works at the end of this post.</li> <li><strong>Third-party plugin developers will be able to add their own blocks</strong> to the Gutenberg interface.</li> <li><strong>You don't have to use the Gutenberg editor.</strong> While it will replace the current text editor in WordPress 5.0, you can disable it by using the official Classic Editor plugin.</li> </ul> <h2>WordPress Gutenberg Editor tutorial: How to use the new editor</h2> <p>Now that you know what the WordPress Gutenberg Editor is, how can you actually use it to create content?</p> <p>The goal of this section is to give you the knowledge that you need to keep creating great content once WordPress 5.0 launches.</p> <h3>Explaining the Gutenberg interface</h3> <p>Here's a quick summary of the most important parts of the Gutenberg Editor interface:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-3.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <ul> <li><strong>A</strong> - these two buttons let you add new blocks.</li> <li><strong>B</strong> - this is the body of the editor.</li> <li><strong>C</strong> - this sidebar lets you control overall document settings, as well as settings for individual blocks.</li> </ul> <h3>Adding content (blocks) to Gutenberg</h3> <p>Adding text content to Gutenberg is simple - you just click and type like you would in the current editor.</p> <p>The only difference here is that each time you hit <strong>Enter</strong>, Gutenberg will create a new paragraph block:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-4.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>If you'd like to insert something other than a paragraph, you can use one of the two <strong>+</strong> icons.</p> <p>Clicking those icons will open up an accordion interface where you can browse all the available blocks (<em>you can also search for blocks by name</em>):</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-5.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Once you insert a block, you'll interact with it in the editing interface, as well as the sidebar. For example, if you insert an image block, you'll be able to access your WordPress Media Library to insert images. And then once you've inserted an image, you can add alt text and modify other settings in the sidebar:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-6.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Similarly, if you add a button, you can click and type to add the button text and then configure colors in the sidebar:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-7.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Finally, not all blocks offer sidebar options. For example, the YouTube block just has you paste in a URL and that's it:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-8.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <h3>Rearranging content in Gutenberg</h3> <p>In the current WordPress editor, you do all your (re)arranging with cut and paste. While Gutenberg still lets you use cut and paste, you also get a few new options.</p> <p>When you hover over any block, you'll see two arrows, as well as six dots, on the left side:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-9.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>To move the block up or down one spot, you can just click the up or down arrow.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can also use drag-and-drop to move blocks by clicking on the six dots and dragging the block to its new spot:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-10.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Finally, you can also rearrange blocks into different layouts. If you add the <strong>Columns</strong> block, you'll be able to insert new blocks inside each column or drag existing blocks into the column layout:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-11.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <h3>Configure backend post settings, like categories, SEO, etc.</h3> <p>There's a lot more to creating WordPress content than just the content...</p> <p>By that, I mean you have a lot of backend \"stuff\" that you need to configure for each post:</p> <ul> <li>Categories and tags</li> <li>URL slugs</li> <li>Featured images</li> <li>SEO settings</li> <li>Social media settings</li> <li>Whether or not to include a post in Bibblio's related content suggestions</li> <li>...you get the idea!</li> </ul> <p>Don't worry - you'll still be able to control all of that with Gutenberg.</p> <p>For most of the core WordPress settings, you can use the <strong>Document</strong> tab of the Gutenberg sidebar:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-12.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>The only thing missing is your content's URL slug, which you can set by clicking on the title:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-13.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>As for settings that you use a plugin for, that will depend on the plugin.</p> <p>Some plugins - like <a href=\"https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Yoast SEO</a> - have already added Gutenberg compatibility. So if you're one of the millions of webmasters who use Yoast SEO, you'll be able to configure your site's SEO from that same <strong>Document</strong> sidebar:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-14.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333; border-top: 0;\"></figure> <p>For other plugins, you'll still be able to use meta boxes like you can with the current WordPress editor. For example, here's what it looks like to add a review box using <a href=\"https://mythemeshop.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MyThemeShop's</a> popular <a href=\"https://mythemeshop.com/plugins/wp-review-pro/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WP Review Pro plugin</a>:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-15.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Each meta box gets its own accordion tab, which helps declutter the interface.</p> <h2>Five tips for working more productively with Gutenberg</h2> <p>From the tutorial above, you might've noticed that using Gutenberg involves a lot more mouse clicks than the current WordPress editor. That might seem like an odd thing to point out, but it's important because it can slow down your content creation process.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be like that, though.</p> <p>Once you've mastered how Gutenberg works at a basic level, there are a number of techniques that you can implement to work more productively with Gutenberg.</p> <p>Here are some of the most helpful shortcuts and tips…</p> <h3>1. Use slash \"/\" to add new blocks more quickly</h3> <p>Rather than clicking the <strong>+</strong> icon every time you want to add a new block, you can insert blocks more quickly by typing \"/\" in an empty block.</p> <p>After the \"/\", start typing the name of the block that you want to insert. Gutenberg will automatically suggest blocks that match, and then you just need to hit <strong>Enter</strong> to insert the block:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-16.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <h3>2. Drag images into Gutenberg from your desktop</h3> <p>Rather than manually adding an image block every time you want to insert an image, you can save time by dragging images straight from your desktop into the Gutenberg interface. Gutenberg will automatically upload them to your WordPress Media Library and <strong>insert them at the proper spot</strong> (<em>that second part is what saves the most time!</em>):</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-17.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p><em>Just make sure you see the blue line - otherwise, the upload won't work.</em></p> <h3>3. Use Gutenberg keyboard shortcuts or markdown</h3> <p>Beyond working with generic keyboard shortcuts (e.g. <em>Ctrl + I for italics</em>), Gutenberg comes with its own special keyboard shortcuts, as well as some support for markdown syntax.</p> <p>To view a full list of keyboard shortcuts, use the <strong>Shift + Alt + H</strong> shortcut:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-18.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>And here's some of the markdown syntax that you can use:</p> <ul> <li>## to insert headers (## is H2, ### is H3, etc.). This will automatically create a Header block.</li> <li>&gt; to insert a quote. This will automatically create a quote block.</li> <li>* to start an unordered list.</li> <li>1. To start an ordered list.</li> </ul> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-19.gif\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <h3>4. Explore the different editor modes (like using a unified toolbar)</h3> <p>Gutenberg offers a number of different modes that you might prefer to the default experience:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Unified Toolbar</strong> - fixes the formatting toolbar to the top of the interface.</li> <li><strong>Full-Screen</strong> - hides the WordPress dashboard sidebar to give you a true full-screen editing experience.</li> <li><strong>Spotlight</strong> - fades out all blocks except the block that you're currently working on.</li> </ul> <p>You can enable them by clicking on the <strong>three dots</strong> icon in the top-right corner. For example, here's what the <strong>Unified Toolbar</strong> mode looks like:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-20.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>You can use multiple modes at the same time. And you can also switch to code editing mode from this same drop-down.</p> <h3>5. Use Gutenberg plugins to add helpful new functionality</h3> <p>Just like WordPress as a whole, the Gutenberg Editor is built to be highly extensible, and developers are already hard at work building extensions that add functionality to Gutenberg.</p> <p>This new functionality comes in a few forms.</p> <p>First, as you already learned, many developers are adding new blocks for their existing plugins, and we have our own plans to create a Bibblio block for our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress related posts plugin</a>.</p> <p>But beyond that, developers are also creating new plugins that are exclusively focused on Gutenberg. These plugins can help you add both content blocks (pricing tables, testimonials, etc.) and layout blocks (more flexible column structures, etc.). Some good examples to start you off are:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Stackable</a> from <a href=\"http://www.gambit.ph/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gambit</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic Blocks</a> from <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Array Themes</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-gutenberg/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Gutenberg</a> from <a href=\"https://www.joomunited.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Joomunited</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a> from <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rich Tabor</a> and <a href=\"https://themebeans.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeBeans</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/kadence-blocks/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kadence Blocks</a> from <a href=\"https://www.kadencethemes.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kadence Themes</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Caxton</a> from <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PootlePress</a></li> </ul> <h2>Here's what will happen to all your old content once WordPress 5.0 is released</h2> <p>Now that you have a good understanding of how the WordPress Gutenberg Editor works, let's end with a quick look at what's going to happen to all of your existing content once WordPress 5.0 is released.</p> <p>Here's a simple test post in the current WordPress editor:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-1.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>And here's what it looks like after activating Gutenberg:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-old-2.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>Notice how it's all in one single <strong>Classic</strong> block, rather than separate blocks? This is done to ensure that the shift to Gutenberg doesn't cause issues with your existing content.</p> <p>You can still interact with your content in the Classic block just like you would in the current editor. For example, you even get the same TinyMCE toolbar:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-old-3.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p>And if you do want to move your old content to Gutenberg, you just need to click the <strong>three dots</strong> icon and choose <strong>Convert to Blocks</strong>. Gutenberg will then automatically break up your existing content into blocks and you'll be able to interact with it like any other Gutenberg post:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/gutenberg/gutenberg-editor-guide-old-4.png\" alt=\"Gutenberg Editor Guide\" style=\"border: 1px solid #333333;\"></figure> <p><strong>And that should be all you need to get up and running once WordPress 5.0 is released in November</strong> (<em>or maybe January…</em>)</p> <p>And remember - if you're already using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bibblio-related-posts/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bibblio related posts plugin</a>, keep an eye out for a Bibblio Gutenberg block. And if you're not, learn how <a href=\"/wordpress\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bibblio can help you display better related content</a> on your WordPress site.</p>",

We covered so much ground that we split the write-up of the evening into three parts. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bibblio.org/blog/Enthusiast%20Media:%20a%20new%20way%20to%20think%20about%20digital?%20externalLink\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first section</a>&nbsp;features our speaker, Guy LeCharles Gonzalez (Publisher at Writer’s Digest and Director of marketing at F+W Media). Last week we had&nbsp;<a href=\"/blog/diversification-in-digital-publishing-part-i\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a>&nbsp;of the panel discussion, featuring Carey Polis (Digital Director from Bon Appetit), Joe LaFalce (VP, Business Development at POPSUGAR) and Daniel Stedman (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Brooklyn Magazine and Northside Media), and here's the final set of insights from the evening.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02b-panel-audience.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing opinions at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>Sharing opinions at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Who’s calling the shots?</h2> <p>Jumping back into the action, Carey had been discussing how it was important to make sure that the editors that they asked to support affiliate promotions were enthusiastic about the products involved. More broadly, Carey said that they don’t try to control their editors when it comes to what they put out e.g. on Instagram, but they encourage them to post Bon Appétit content, and they’d step in if they posted something out of line.</p> <p>Mads noted that now individuals / editors are becoming stars. In the past, everyone new National Geographic but didn’t know who was taking the pictures, but now that’s switching around, and in some cases people know the individual rather than the brand they work for. He speculated that publishers and media might need to find creative ways to work with talent in the future as the relationship between employer and employee changes.</p> <h2>Leaving money on the historical table?</h2> <p>Mads moved on to suggest that publishers had historically sold the value they created short – only putting ads next to content when all these other opportunities existed. He asked the panel what they thought about that idea.</p> <p>Carey agreed, but said that this was a function of how the industry had worked before. In the past, editors didn’t have to care as much about making money as they do now. ‘Church and State’, the strict division between editorial staff and the money people, has been dismantled. Her role is a good example of the new hybrid approach. Technically her role is all about content, but she talks to the ad team every day. It used to be enough to wait for the ad team to book the revenue, but times have changed, and good editors are involved in the conversation.</p> <p>Daniel saw parallels between the situation for publishers and how the ad agency business has changed too. Agencies have launched incredible brands, e.g. air Jordan, but in the past they didn’t get a slice of the real value, and some still have essentially no intellectual property in their creations. They’re really suffering because of that. It’s similar for publishers. They relied on other people with things they wanted to sell advertizing those things on their sites, but times have changed, and now it’s time for them to sell the stuff themselves.</p> <p>Joe agreed, but wasn’t sure that it was fair to suggest that publishers had sold themselves short – they simply didn’t have to do that much in the past to have very profitable businesses. Crushing it in the industry used to be sitting behind your desk at Time magazine, smoking a few cigarettes, and booking 5 million dollars in ad revenue each year. Now the rules have changed radically without a lot of input from publishers, and they’re trying to play catch-up. There’s no doubt that they’ve been slow to react and that they were resting on their laurels during the rise of digital and social, but that was the way the machine worked. You didn’t need to sell baby books, or have a clothing line, or even a great commercial strategy really.</p> <h2>Leaving legacy</h2> <p>Mads asked to what extent it was an advantage to be digital first and not have to deal with legacy issues?</p> <p>Joe said that it had been eye-opening for him coming to Popsugar from Time inc. Until the early teens of the 2000s print was still the kingmaker, and for a lot of legacy publishers print is still maybe the biggest revenue driver. It’s far better not to be saddled by a business model that’s increasingly less relevant, but Popsugar is also culturally more nimble and flexible, with a hungrier atmosphere. He’s found it a great experience to transfer to a digital native.</p> <p>Mads next question was on ethics and the role of media. The ‘Church and State’ separation was traditionally viewed as a good thing, meaning that the editorial team didn’t have to concern themselves, or have their editorial choices influenced, by needing to make money. What’s the downside of the new world?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02-audience.jpg\" alt=\"The audience at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>The audience at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <p>Carey said it was important to keep an eye on your moral compass, and Bon Appétit say no to a lot of opportunities even though there’s no longer the ‘Church and State’ demarcation. It’s important to stay close to what editors believe in, or you just damage the product. There’s a constant give and take though. Some publishing and media brands don’t do a good job of maintaining the balance; they acquiesce too easily to revenue pressure and lose a lot of brand value that way. You certainly lose when you’re not equal with your commercial partners and you let one side manipulate the conversation.</p> <h2>Short term vs. long term thinking</h2> <p>Mads wondered if it was fair to say that, as the industry evolves, editorial’s role will be to think about long-term revenue and commercial’s role will be to think about the quarter?</p> <p>Carey was ambivalent, but said that she thought that making editors responsible for revenue complicates things.</p> <p>Daniel changed the focus of the statement, saying that it was brand equity, not long-term revenue, that they should be focussing on building. That ultimately drives value and gives the sales team something to sell.</p> <p>Carey talked about some of the risks of being too keen to increase revenue, especially when a partner doesn’t chime with your audience. Bon Appétit’s style is to advocate working with the farmers’ market and your local farmer because that’s what connects with their audience.</p> <p>Daniel offered that young people don’t mind being marketed to. They don’t mind advertizers, they don’t mind sponsors, but, they don’t want to be marketed crap. There has to be an organic fit between your product and the partner.</p> <h2>Helping brands make their mark</h2> <p>Mads suggested that it’s actually in the brand’s interest to challenge advertizers – if you challenge them and make them work in line with your brand’s authentic character then advertizers also get the most value from the partnership.</p> <p>Joe said that Popsugar tackle this question a lot in their content studio. When a brand buys a big native or branded content package, they need to buy into the vision of the team and rely on them to come up with a really strong idea and creative that they know is going to resonate with the audience. They need to trust that the team know how to communicate with Popsugar’s audience on social and their own site.</p> <p>Brands often have a strong idea of what they want to do, and it’s a delicate dance as Popsugar are ultimately the ones who know how to connect with their audience. The best relationships are the ones where clients recognise that and lean into the authority of Popsugar. The importance of getting that conversation right is reflected in the metric of ‘returning brands’, which is really important for The Bakery.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02b-panel.jpg\" alt=\"The panel at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>The panel at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <p>Mads asked about demonstrating success in branded content, and what metrics do the panellists show to brands to justify the spend?</p> <p>Joe said that Popsugar we show partners engagement metrics like video views and time spent with content. As he’d mentioned, the leading metric for themselves is returning brands.</p> <p>Daniel said that Northside are very focussed on live events, even though Brooklyn magazine is the tentpole for the business, so branded is less of a focus for them. Regarding event spend by partners, In the past events have been measured anecdotally – if the CEO’s 15 year old kid said it was awesome they’ll come back and sponsor again next year. Now they’re hearing “you’re on brand, you’re on message, but we need to measure ROI”. If they’re not driving value to sponsors in a measurable way then they don’t expect them to come back.</p> <p>Carey said that if the point is to integrate branded content with editorial, then it can’t ever come across in a way that brings advertizing to mind. At Bon Appétit they’re always concentrating on aligning branded content with the editorial packages they’re most excited about.</p> <h2>Changing channels</h2> <p>An audience member asked the panel about how they chose which social channels to concentrate on.</p> <p>Carey suggested choosing a couple of key platforms to concentrate on: e.g. Bon Appétit are not on Snapchat, they don’t have resources to do everything really well, and that will be true for most businesses. Choose the ones that really identify with your values and go all in.</p> <p>Joe also emphasized being strategic. Pick a lane and build up brand equity. Popsugar started as pop culture and entertainment, and spent a few years building credibility there before expanding into general lifestyle play. Young brands can get a lot from working with a really well-thought-through strategic partner strategy. They can distribute your content, swap Facebook stories etc. It helps to get your brand and name out there, and legacy brands who are often less adept at these channels can be very willing to partner. Popsugar now have a very big partnership team, and 150 partners in their network. They’re constantly talking to them and swapping stories. This is a great example of a guerrilla tactic to tap into audiences that already exist.</p> <p>Another audience member questioned the upside of that approach. They had worked with Business Insider and ended up getting only 9,000 unique visits when an article that they shared with BI got 900,000.</p> <p>Carey’s advice was that you have to expect that you might have some key partnerships, but a lot won’t work. Bon Appétit used to do a lot of social shares featuring partners, but they’ve since scaled back. If you’re not careful then other people get the SEO benefit and you get nothing. It’s partly a process of trial and error, and if you’re serious about it then you should keep trying. Maybe 1/5 does work.</p> <p>Another audience question was about the split between desktop and mobile. Carey said that their split was about 60/40 mobile, and unsurprizingly a lot more mobile is coming through Instagram, although it’s still far from the majority. She thinks should be thinking about what they can do tech and product wise to support mobile visitors. The role that AMP plays in that isn’t clear - it seems to be a bit up and down. She doesn’t like the way the AMP pages look, and the industry seems to blow hot and cold on it. It’s also currently not very clear how AMP is affecting monetization.</p> <h2>Subscribing to new ideas?</h2> <p>Mads asked Carey about subscription, which has been one of the bigger trends in the shifting publishing and media business model landscape. She said that subscription is not really part of their revenue. Mads suggested that e.g. monthly recipe packages, or some food-based variant on the Michelle Kwan samples box model could resonate with their audience? Did the panel see growth here?</p> <p>Carey said that they had felt like there are so many recipes freely available on the internet that a paywall wouldn’t work… However the New York Times did put a paywall around their cooking site recently, and now have 100,000 paying subscribers, so there was clearly some room for this approach.</p> <p>Joe said that Popsugar’s approach to subscription was to base it around a higher level of service. They don’t want to put the main site behind a paywall and take away things they’ve been giving to their audience for free. Advertizing still makes them a lot of money, so there’s no immediate reason to throw up a paywall in any case. For a brand like Popsugar the main opportunity for paywalled content is specific products where it could work, like a fitness video package they’re working on.</p> <p>As a final thought, Daniel remarked that he wasn’t that fluent in the subject, but he saw blockchain really changing things and allowing much more community stakeholding and ownership of entities. He wasn’t that thrilled about the current media landscape, where media properties largely owned by the ultra-rich. Blockchain is very new technology, and most people hear about it in the form of crypto currency, but he’d love to see its capabilities being used to make membership and e.g. micropayments an easier business model for publishing and media.</p> <p>That's all from this edition of the Future of Media and Publishing from New York: check out our speaker Guy LeCharles Gonzalez on Enthusiast Media <a href=\"https://app.hubspot.com/content-detail/1709849/blog-post/6267040558/performance\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and Part I of the panel discussion <a href=\"/blog/diversification-in-digital-publishing-part-i\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.

We covered so much ground that we split the write-up of the evening into three parts. The <a href=\"Enthusiast Media: a new way to think about digital? externalLink\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first section</a>&nbsp;features our speaker, Guy LeCharles Gonzalez (Publisher at Writer’s Digest and Director of marketing at F+W Media). Now we have the panel, featuring Carey Polis (Digital Director from Bon Appetit), Joe LaFalce (VP, Business Development at POPSUGAR) and Daniel Stedman (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Brooklyn Magazine and Northside Media). Enjoy Part I!</p> <h2>Search, social, or somewhere else?</h2> <p>Mads introduced the theme of the evening, which was approaches and strategies for diversifying audience and revenue. The opening question was what does traffic composition look like for each of the panellists right now?</p> <p>Carey said that search is currently more than 50% of their traffic, social is about 20% (down from 30-40% a couple of years ago), the newsletter is 10/15% and ‘other’ makes up the rest. She’s pretty happy with the current mix – it’s search heavy, but that reflects the nature of Bon Appétit’s audience.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02b-panel.jpg\" alt=\"The panel at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>The panel at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <p>Daniel said that the traffic figures for the Northside media properties are pretty small, and diversification for them is primarily about their different sister projects. Northside’s story started with just the L Magazine, which ran for 12 years, and now the business has branched out to other sites, live events and they’ve also created a content studio (“every media company has one now”, Daniel quipped). Diversification became a necessity for them when the print event listings business collapsed, which is a familiar story to many publishers.</p> <p>Although live events anchor the business these days, you couldn’t just take the digital offering away and not see a significant impact – it’s the marriage between content and live events that creates the best results. This was something that we’d heard back in the UK as well at the <a href=\"/blog/metrics-channels-innovation-and-trust-whats-on-the-minds-of-digital-publishers\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of Digital Media and Publishing</a> from Linda Blank at SUITCASE Media.</p> <p>Joe said that, like Bon Appétit, the majority of Popsugar’s traffic comes from search and social, and another big source for them is strategic partners who feature their content. Joe certainly wants to drive traffic to the site so ad-teams can generate sales, but he’s also looking to build specific communities on social platforms, and they’ve invested heavily in these. The nature of the content that they put out on those platforms is very important, as it defines what the audience is going to be. YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat: each platform needs a slightly different approach to make sure that they connect with the audience. It’s really important to Popsugar that they build trust with these communities.</p> <h2>Is Facebook your friend?</h2> <p>In a conversation about traffic, Mads inevitably brought up the implosion in Facebook referrals since the algorithm change earlier this year. It’s taken down a number of businesses who built their business model solely on Facebook traffic, the latest being Unilad. He added that it was now common in the VC world for investors to be wary of media businesses; many had boasted of impressive traffic and visitor metrics (perhaps too impressive…) but had then been unable to monetize those audiences. How do you make money from social communities?</p> <p>Joe said that Popsugar has been relatively lucky, and was still getting healthy traffic from social: they have seen volatility, but not really a decline. He put this down to the high quality content that they produce and the strong relationship that they have with their community. The key is figuring out how to cultivate trust on the platforms and then how to sustain relationships. Popsugar has managed that, and the result is social visitors clicking through to the site a lot. That leads to monetization.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02b-panel-audience.jpg\" alt=\"Sharing opinions at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>Sharing opinions at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <p>Carey said, perhaps surprisingly, that the Facebook algorithm change had actually been positive for Bon Appétit. It had certainly led to volatility in social traffic, yes, but realising that it was a mistake to rely on Facebook had given them the freedom to return to prioritizing content quality. Simply trying to acquire (often low-quality) volume had stopped being the priority. As traffic numbers fell they began to prioritize other metrics like engagement, and that has led to changing the way they look at their audience, in a positive way. Of course ‘engagement’ is harder to measure numerically, but using it as the north star has really improved brand visibility and has had very positive effects: traffic is up significantly year-on-year.</p> <p>The shift means that they now care so much more about editorial content strategy, and Carey said that that can be seen in the growing strength of their writing, visuals and brand identity. They get to prioritize the quality of what appears on the website above everything else. All in all, it’s a great time to be a content creator.</p> <p>Daniel said that Brooklyn Magazine and The L never reached traffic numbers where programmatic advertising was meaningful at all, so volume was perhaps less crucial to them. They have tried different advertizing tools, but never at the scale. In one sense they missed the boat, but in another it meant that they always got to focus on making quality content.</p> <h2>God is a metric</h2> <p>Connecting with the talk about the changing approach to measuring success, Mads asked each of the panellists what their “god metric” was – what you’d be thinking about if you woke up and checked your phone at 3am…</p> <p>Joe said that, for him, the key metric is returning visits as a percentage of total traffic. A high proportion of returning traffic shows him that they’re doing a good job of building trust and establishing a strong bond with their target community.</p> <p>Daniel said that Northside wasn’t at the scale where returning visitors is a particularly meaningful metric. He’s more concerned about in-visit engagement, measured in engaged minutes, a metric which he’s discovered during the last year.</p> <p>Carey said that the way they measure engagement is the number of ‘loyal visitors’, which to them means somebody who makes at least four visits to the site a month.</p> <h2>Turning loyalty into gold</h2> <p>With the theme of valuing engaged and returning visitors, Mads asked how you turn that loyalty into revenue.</p> <p>Carey said that video has led to the biggest increase in revenue for them. It’s now a significant part of their overall revenue, and even two years ago it would have been a very small part. A lot of this money is coming from YouTube, and working with sponsors making white-labelled content. Examples of their video products are the 4+1 package, which consists of four editorial episodes and then one branded episode, or a branded series.</p> <p>Adjusting to video had been a learning process – they didn’t know a lot about YouTube strategy, and worked with video people at Condé Nast to create one. One thing that they learnt is that they have a lot of editors who are great on camera. This only came to light when they were screen-tested. In response to this they’re Investing in editors and changing priorities, for instance the ‘test kitchen’ is now all on camera which wasn’t the case. They had 1 million subscribers three or four months ago, and they’re now at well over 2 million, so there’s huge growth. Operational changes have also been necessary to allow for this success. One thing Carey noted about this is that at legacy publishers people can get very used to “this is my lane”, so it’s important to be flexible and try to get out of that mindset.</p> <p>A question was asked about Bon Appétit’s video strategy on YouTube: how are they managing content and output – is it part of a set strategy or is it left to the editors who are becoming influencers in their own right?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02-audience.jpg\" alt=\"The audience at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City\"> <figcaption>The audience at the Future of Media and Publishing meetup, New York City</figcaption> </figure> <p>Carey said that they’ve had a lot of conversations about this in the company. Editors want to be careful with brands they represent, as it’s very personal, and they’re quite sensitive about it. What gets worked on is primarily driven by the partners coming in who want to collaborate with Bon Appétit. Then there’s usually a conversation about what the brand wants to do, and then they work out which particular editors profile it fits with.</p> <p>Daniel said that 50% of Northside’s income comes from live experiences, so social revenue etc. wasn’t something that he thought about a lot. Diversification of revenue had actually posed a bit of a problem for them. At one stage they reached a point where they had too many revenue channels for a relatively small company. The content studio was growing very quickly but wasn’t creating value for the Northside festival, then the festival was driving a lot of visits to Brooklyn magazine but sponsorship packages didn’t reflect that. One solution to that was to try and attribute revenues better and annualize them, but it’s not an easy balance for them to strike.</p> <p>Joe said that the majority of advertising revenue for Popsugar comes from their branded and native content studio – The Bakery – whose content is then distributed across social. Display revenue is declining for them, which isn’t a surprise. It’s still tough, as it’s high margin, but on the other hand it doesn’t drive the repeat business that the branded content studio does drive and which leads to stable growth.</p> <h2>New horizons for monetization</h2> <p>Mads asked the panel what is the true role of content in modern digital publishing and media businesses? He mentioned the famous diagram which Walt Disney drew to explain how his business worked: the feature film is in the middle of the page, and arrows lead from it in all directions illustrating how it supports and enables many other revenue streams, like the parks and merchandize. Mads was curious about what that map would like for each of the panellists? Does content work for them they way it does for Disney?</p> <p>Joe agreed that content had to be thought of as an enabler of other revenue streams, and that he’d even made a version of that graphic before himself.</p> <p>In that spirit, Popsugar has leant into lots of new business lines this year. They’ve launched a branded ready to wear line with Kohl’s which is in 1000 stores across the country, and a beauty line with Ulta, leveraging the power of the brand. This is why trust and connection with the brand is so important – Popsugar can take 30,000,000 people to these new products. They’ve created experiential business lines too, e.g. Play/Ground, celebrating the playful and grounded side of people, which was visited by 10,000 women over two days. They’ve also launched a new content development studio, Toy Rocket, which is working directly with studios and television networks to incubate and produce long-form content and pitch to producers and studios.</p> <p>Diversification is going well, but there are still parts of the puzzle they need to figure out, because it’s a key way to de-risk the ups and downs of an unpredictable ad market. This is really important for resilience, not to mention that they’ve got really strong brand equity and a loyal audience which they wouldn't be monetizing properly if they were only serving ads.</p> <p>Carey said that one example of where content enabled other monetization was with affiliate revenue, and that in-article affiliate promotions were something that Bon Appétit are doing a lot now. They hired an e-commerce editor last year, which she admitted was quite late to the party, but they’d had a lot of success with the concept as it works very well for cooking. This is because of the combination of the opportunity to recommend products organically in content, and the trust that their audience have in them. They always disclose affiliate products, and their editors are experts who don’t recommend anything that they don’t believe in, which is key to maintaining that trust. As an example of how successful it can be, an affiliate sold 4,000 towels on Amazon a few weeks ago after being featured on Bon Appétit.</p> <p>Mads suggested that, as a brand, you need to start from the position of having demonstrated the expertise before you can tie that in to e-commerce. Carey agreed, and said that part of the overall strategy is to be very driven by particular expert personalities. Their editors are well known and are big on Instagram and feature in YouTube videos. They’re also careful in what they endorse – you won’t find any roundups of the ‘15 best examples’ of something. It’s all personally promoting individual products: “this is the gravy boat we’re really into right now”.</p> <p>That's all for Part I - as you can see, there was a lot of really great in depth discussion on some key topics. Keep any eye out for Part II, which we'll be releasing next week.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>Introducing a new mental model to help publishers think about audience strategy</p> <!--more--> <p>On 20 September Bibblio and our friends at <a href=\"https://www.sovrn.com/\" rel=\" noopener\">Sovrn</a> brought the Future of Media and Publishing meetup back to New York City, getting together a group of future-oriented publishers to discuss how the industry is changing and what they’re doing to adapt. We covered so much ground that we’ve split the write-up of the evening into three parts: the first part features our speaker, <a href=\"http://loudpoet.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Guy LeCharles Gonzalez</a>&nbsp;(Publisher at <a href=\"http://www.writersdigest.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Writer’s Digest</a> and Director of marketing at F+W Media), and the other parts will cover the panel, which featured Carey Polis (Digital Director from Bon Appetit), Joe LaFalce (VP, Business Development at POPSUGAR) and Daniel Stedman (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Brooklyn Magazine and Northside Media).</p> <h3>Enthusiast Media?</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-Guy-LeCharles-Gonzalez.jpg\" alt=\"Guy LeCharles Gonzalez, director of marketing at Writer’s Digest\"> <figcaption>Guy LeCharles Gonzalez, director of marketing at Writer’s Digest</figcaption> </figure> <p>Guy’s talk introduced the audience to the idea of ‘Enthusiast Media’: what defines it, how the business model works, and what you need to do if you want to leverage the model in your own business. First of all, it’s not big scale consumer media, which to Guy is the least interesting part of the media business anyway. It’s so dependent on ads, you fundamentally don’t control your own fate.</p> <p>So, what is an Enthusiast Media company?</p> <p>It’s a truly diversified company that brings a specific community together across multiple platforms and connects them to the information, inspiration, and resources they need to pursue their shared interests and individual goals.</p> <p>Four key traits define an Enthusiast Media business:</p> <ul> <li>Creates and publishes inspirational or instructional content in multiple formats across multiple platforms</li> <li>Engages and nurtures enthusiasts through lead journeys, content and other experiences</li> <li>Connects enthusiasts to each other, and potentially third parties (advertisers are still a part of this space)</li> <li>Produces relevant products and services to serve the enthusiasts needs and interests, a notable percentage of which they pay for - this is what separates Enthusiast Media from general consumer and some B2B</li> </ul> <p>A lot of B2B publishers also share some of these characteristics.</p> <p>Guy offered some examples of Enthusiast Media. Red Bull is a particularly interesting case study. The core brand is the drink, but group contains various media properties as well, and they’re each treated as a stand-alone business – they have to be profitable on their own. This obviously isn’t the way that brands usually approach content marketing, but Red Bull have such a strong brand and are so good at serving their community that the approach works for them.</p> <p>Another example is Skift, who have carved out a unique space in travel, providing global travel industry intelligence. A good example of a media company doing something similar in another vertical would be The Business of Fashion. Ascribing to Guy's model of an Enthusiast Media company, Skift monetise in a number of different ways. As well as traditional advertising, they have subscription products and content marketing / native advertising, e.g. partner research pieces.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02-enthusiast.jpg\" alt=\"What is Enthusiast Media? by Guy LeCharles Gonzalez\"> <figcaption>What is Enthusiast Media? by Guy LeCharles Gonzalez</figcaption> </figure> <p>It almost goes without saying that for a company to be Enthusiast Media its content has to be valuable and not commoditised.</p> <p>Because of the way Enthusiast Media concentrates on the valued community members, not volume, their KPIs are different to normal media – no vanity metrics like page views here. What matters to an Enthusiast Media company is the depth of engagement and how to nurture people through the journey that leads to revenue.</p> <h3>Enthusiasts are different</h3> <p>It’s important to understand that Enthusiasts are a subset of general consumers, and that’s true even within a vertical. People make the mistake of thinking that everyone in a vertical has a monolithic set of interests, and that you can just produce a load of vaguely targeted content and get a lot of traction. That’s not so.</p> <p>Anyone who thought they could just throw up a niche publishing company off the back of the Facebook “magic button” a few years ago isn’t in business anymore. They didn’t really have a plan, they had access to an audience they didn’t own. Enthusiast Media own their audience and they know them inside out - you can't produce content and assume it will resonate with everyone in a broad demographic.</p> <p>Guy illustrated this point by describing how they work at Writers’ Digest. They recognise that writers aren’t all the same, and they have four primary categories of reader: the Fiction Writer, the Memoirist, the Freelance Writer and the Screenwriter. Each category has some overlap and commonalities, but there are important variations, and they target them with different content. Even writing students aren’t all the same - they study different things!</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02-audience.jpg\" alt=\"The audience\"></figure> <p>One of Writer’s Digest’s primary 'competitors' is Poets &amp; Writers. Poets &amp; Writers targets a specific subset of writers of literary fiction and poetry. Because of their focus on those two categories, they serve that audience in ways Writer’s Digest can’t, engaging with them from a different perspective. But, you can’t make that strategic decision if you don’t know your overall audience really well.</p> <p>In many ways, when you’re an Enthusiast Media company your main competitor is your own audience – they want to talk to and learn from each other as much as you. Advertising partners are also your competitors, since&nbsp;<span>in a specialised space</span>&nbsp;many are also looking to develop close relationships with their customers, often based on content. How do you reach enthusiasts and engage them when there’s so much happening around them? The only way is to really understand the channels they engage with and what kind of content you need to push to earn their attention.</p> <h3>Enthusiast Media in metrics</h3> <p>Enthusiast Media is not primarily driven by advertising. This means that you can’t have vanity metric KPIs. Some more useful metrics that Guy suggested are new visitors via search &amp; social, pages/session, email acquisition and email open rates and CTRs. Another useful deep metric that we’ve come across recently, used by Enthusiast Media like Physics World, is returning visitors.</p> <p>Guy also made a subtle point about the way we talk about measuring those metrics and what we do with the information we gather. Too many people talk about being “data-driven”. Don’t let data drive you, he said – data should inform you. Data, on its own, is useless if you don’t have a plan and a way to use it to make decisions that generate revenue. There’s a lot of technology now to help publishers measure and collect data, but that technology only has value if you're using the data well.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompnyc02-strategy.jpg\" alt=\"Data-Informed Content Strategy by Guy LeCharles Gonzalez\"> <figcaption>Data-Informed Content Strategy by Guy LeCharles Gonzalez</figcaption> </figure> <p>A little while ago the internet shifted from being a way to connect people to being a way to sell people things. That was maybe inevitable, but a lot of people are uncomfortable with that (with good reason, but we won’t go into that here). The best media brands recognise that: they aren’t always trying to sell sell sell sell sell. If you serve your community well and you have a good product then the sales will come naturally.</p> <p>When it comes to Enthusiast Media companies working with advertisers, Guy says that the secret sauce is finding an advertising partner that really cares about your audience and treats them respectfully. The right partner helps you produce great content and material that teaches your audience.</p> <p>Guy’s talk introduced a really interesting new mental model for the audience to think about the vertical and niche publishing space with. I’m sure more than a few people will be integrating it into their strategy and how they think about their business in the future. Following Guy was our panel discussion, which we’ll cover in the next instalments from FOMP NYC.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>Takeaways from the panel at the first State of Media and Digital Publishing event in London</p> <!--more--> <p>On Tuesday 11th September, a group of London’s forward thinking digital publishers gathered at WeWork Shoreditch for the first State of Media and Digital Publishing event. SMDP (for short) is a new event dedicated to insights and actionable advice on how to thrive in the industry.</p> <p>With two knowledgeable speakers and a panel of industry innovators, we were well set up for a great evening. We want everyone to be able to benefit from what we learnt, so we’re publishing two in-depth articles about the event, and this is the second, reporting the key points from our panel discussion. You can find the first <a href=\"/blog/does-digital-publishing-success-mean-going-analogue\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-panel-alex.jpg\" alt=\"The panel, moderated by Alex Price, founder and Managing Director, 93digital\"> <figcaption>The panel, moderated by Alex Price, founder and Managing Director, 93digital</figcaption> </figure> <h3>How to measure up</h3> <p>Alex Price, founder and Managing Director of agency 93digital, moderated our panel and kicked off by asking whether there’s a single metric that digital publishers should be concentrating on that defines success.</p> <p>Mads Holmen, founder and CEO of Bibblio, suggested that the key for publishers, even if it can seem hard with quarter targets coming up, is thinking longer-term. You need to survive, but you’re not going to thrive unless you build a brand. He said that publishers need to try to move from measuring clicks to deeper metrics like time spent, and really get a grip on whether audiences are happy with the experience.</p> <p>Carl Hazeley, VP Content at Finimize, said that the metric that really mattered to them was Net Promoter Score – everything boils down to that. For Carl, this is the real measure of who will recommend and push your product, and Finimize can see that reflected in the growth of their newsletter and app.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-dens-milne.jpg\" alt=\"Dens Milne\"> <figcaption>Dens Milne, Senior Product Manager, Physics World</figcaption> </figure> <p>Dens Milne, Senior Product Manager from Physics World, chose returning visitor rate as their most important metric. To her that’s the best measure of loyal users. Returning users stay longer and are more committed to your product.</p> <p>Reflecting on Mads’ response, Alex asked how publishers and their employees can actually break free from the pressure of the next performance review?</p> <p>Mads admitted that this is the million dollar question for publishers, and he didn’t have a simple answer. He suggested that publishers have to live their lives as much in the future as they can without jeopardising today. In any case, whatever your shorter-term concerns, it helps to have one metric that tells you the ‘truth’ about the long-term success of your business, even if it’s not the one that’s managed. NPS, as Carl suggested, could be the right one. Alex wanted to know if commercial leads will actually accept NPS as a relevant metric, and Carl said that this was certainly true at Finimize.</p> <h3>Changing channels?</h3> <p>The question then shifted to acquisition channels. Dens said that, for Physics world, organic search and direct visits were responsible for the vast majority of visits. This is pretty unusual, and she conceded that Physics World isn’t your average publisher because of the longevity and niche nature of their content. This means that Facebook’s algorithm changes haven’t really affected them. Although their social numbers dipped at the beginning of the year, they’ve since come back up, and social referrals have only ever accounted for about 4% of their traffic.</p> <p>Alice Revel, founder and Editor of book box subscription service Reading in Heels and Running in Heels, said that their most important channel was also organic. In their case though it’s in the form of word-of-mouth, often on social platforms. So far, they’ve actually done no paid digital marketing: growth has all come from consumer advocates. Facebook has also been a useful channel for them. Since the deprioritization of content following the algorithm change they’ve created a Facebook group which has been successful in attracting engaged members.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-carl-hazeley.jpg\" alt=\"Carl Hazeley\"> <figcaption>Carl Hazeley, VP Content, Finimize</figcaption> </figure> <p>Carl said that at Finimize, whose users don't pay for access, the main acquisition channel is referral through sharing. This mainly happens on Twitter and Instagram though - Facebook is actually not a large part of their traffic.</p> <p>It was an interesting part of the discussion, and highlighted that the different business models within publishing require diverse approaches to audience acquisition. Not all content is the same. It was also interesting to hear that nobody was relying significantly on Facebook.</p> <h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">New horizons?</h3> <p>Mads agreed with Dens that returning visitors are the most valuable, and publishers should try to avoid too much new traffic. Think of new visitors as being like tourists: if you’re not careful then what’s cool can change very quickly and then tourists all go to a different part of town. Although Google seems to be a more stable source of traffic than Facebook, the fact that around 80% of all traffic to publishers is coming from these sources is a strategic danger sign. One solution to that is to look to genuinely new channels to diversify acquisition.</p> <p>One channel that publishers seem to be ignoring completely is… each other. Faced with the threats in the ecosystem, Mads suggested that publishers need to see other publishers as friends not enemies. YouTube stars have known for a long time that cross-pollination of audiences from similar channels is good for everyone, and they’re happy to feature one another on their channels. They’ve realised that they’re rarely directly competing, even with channels with similar content. They’re competing with other distractions and someone logging off because they can’t find anything else that’s interesting.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-alice-revel.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Revel\"> <figcaption>Alice Revel, founder and Editor, Reading in Heels and Running in Heels</figcaption> </figure> <p>The next question Alex asked was about how to get the balance right with the different commercial models available to digital publishers. Alice said that this didn’t really apply to her, since book boxes were her main product, but despite the struggles of many physical publishers, they’d had great engagement offline. The interesting challenge for them was actually making people put their phones away! She pointed out that there are now just so many content sites out there, and as digital sources increase the meaning and relevance of most of them decreases. This echoed Linda’s earlier comments on the importance of differentiation. It’s getting harder, and more important, to stand out.</p> <p>Dens noted that Physics World have their physical magazine, so as well as advertising they also use a subscription model. Advertising means that volume is important to them and that affects priorities, but it also means that there’s a strong incentive to use data to make ads more relevant and to target people with products in a more tailored way.</p> <p>Mads zoomed the discussion right out, mentioning a famous illustration by Walt Disney showing while films were core to the business, their significance wasn't the just income they generated, it was the way that they supported a whole range of other money-making activities, like merchandising, theme parks and games.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-walt-disney.png\" alt=\"Walt Disney's famous illustration\"> <figcaption>Walt Disney's famous illustration</figcaption> </figure> <p>Publishing needs to focus on content in the same way as Walt Disney focussed on films, as the enabler of a whole range of other ways of making money. This was something that Linda Blank, from SUITCASE Media, had talked about earlier in the evening, with a particular emphasis on print. Every business is different though, and the key thing is getting the right mix, as Alex had alluded to. The Daily Mail Online is primarily a high volume advertising play, but they’re now doing a lot of affiliate sales. Dennis Publishing now make a huge amount of their revenue, forecast to be 45% in 2018, by promoting their second-hand car sales business, Buyacar, on the three biggest auto magazines in the UK, which they own.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-mads-holmen.jpg\" alt=\"Mads Holmen\"> <figcaption>Mads Holmen, founder and CEO, Bibblio</figcaption> </figure> <p>Mads maintained that publishers haven’t been creating enough value from the audiences they’ve made, but they’re getting better at it. More needs to be done though. Why was he seeing adverts on BBC good food for shoes at 6:45 on a Friday evening? For all the talk about clever technology, the ad industry is still pretty bad at delivering value to audiences. Publishers should think about how they can own the relationship rather than outsourcing it: they know their audiences a lot better than the ad networks do, and they should use that.</p> <p>Carl mentioned ASOS.com in this context. One of the reasons they were so successful in their space was because they understood their audience. When it came to social channels, they were sharing anything they thought was cool, not just their own clothes. This gave them authenticity, because their followers saw quality contributions that they wanted to see, not just what ASOS wanted them to buy. Mads added that ASOS also created their own team of influencers in house as part of this strategy.</p> <h3>Trust issues?</h3> <p>Alice commented that she sees a lot of mistrust around influencer marketing these days: consumers are realising that a lot of apparently organic coverage is actually bought. In particular there’s a lot of suspicion around the affiliate model, and brands need to rethink how they do that. She said that the solution was prioritising authenticity – the right partnerships with the right brands – and being transparent when commercial relationships exist. Don’t try to pass things off as organic when they’re not. People know.</p> <p>Mads said that he had thought about this, and that there actually seems to be a split going on here. One part of society is now very savvy and demands authenticity, and they’re a very valuable market, but with the rest of consumers, the people peddling dodgy endorsements are winning. He had read recently that Instagram influencer / YouTuber is now the top job choice of a staggering number of American teens in recent surveys, and the vast majority of paid-for posts on Instagram don’t actually have #ad on them. He suggested that we’re seeing this general split across the board – in politics too – and the scary thing is there seems to be the commoditization of people’s attention.</p> <p>Considering this, Dens said that the Physics World audience are firmly in the first camp Mads mentioned, because of the rationalist, evidence-based tendency of people interested in their content. Physics World is very careful to badge native content clearly, and they don’t use Instagram. Alice said that she didn’t use Instagram either, and that a full page spread in Vogue was by far the most effective campaign they’d ever run.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-panel-above.jpg\" alt=\"The audience and panel at the first State of Media and Digital Publishing event\"> <figcaption>The audience and panel at the first State of Media and Digital Publishing event</figcaption> </figure> <p>Mads returned to the trust problems that Alice was describing in digital, suggesting that they can actually be brand building opportunities for companies. To illustrate this he mentioned the well-known story in Denmark of McKinsey and the Danish equivalent of the BBC. McKinsey realised that they couldn’t actually do the digital transformation job that they’d been hired for, and instead of taking the money and keeping quiet, they owned up and forfeited the contract. That honesty is now their calling card. Similarly, publishers can really distinguish themselves by championing transparency in their dealings with advertisers and their audiences.</p> <p>Mads finished by saying that above all, publishers need to recognise that they live in the attention economy. The average American sleeps one hour less than they used to, and that time is often being replaced by media. The age of Trump has exposed the fact that a lot of the media and tech companies we used to admire have been abusing our trust. Fundamentally, their business models mean that they need to consume more and more of our time and data to keep growing their profits. That’s a problem that’s increasingly being recognised. Digital publishers can’t compete and shouldn’t try to become more like them – the future lies in quality content and audience trust.</p>",

We want everyone to be able to benefit from what we learnt, so we’re publishing two in-depth articles about the event, starting with the talks from our speakers. Both speakers were from digital publishers who still have print publications and whose success rests on being thought leaders in a particular vertical. Is there a connection?</span></p> <h3>Physics World makes a big bang with its new site</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dens-milne.jpg\" alt=\"Dens Milne\"> <figcaption>Dens Milne, Senior Product Manager, Physics World</figcaption> </figure> <p>Dens Milne is Senior Product Manager at Physics World, a monthly print publication with a popular website. She started by telling the crowd about how the company had found itself with a problem. They had great content, 20 years and 95,000 articles of it, but they hadn’t updated their website for a long time. Having an old system was creating a real cost: they didn’t have the tools to make the most of both that content and also the goodwill they’d built up with their audience. Things were disjointed and hard to manage. This meant they were missing out on opportunities to grow users and advertising revenue. So, they needed to build a new website, and brought in London WordPress agency 93Digital to do the job.</p> <p>Just how much they were missing out became clear when the job was done: the website is outperforming all of its competitors and has seen strong growth in registered users, with 60% of them are opting in to receiving advertising messages. 40% of users have also rated the new website a 9 or 10 out of 10. What did they do to get these kinds of results?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-physicsworld-front.jpg\" alt=\"Physics World Homepage\"> <figcaption>The new Physics World homepage</figcaption> </figure> <p>One thing that Dens felt really helped was paying close attention to the information architecture: every piece of content is now defined and tagged with article type and subject. This was, unsurprisingly, a lot of work. They had to change all of the content URLs whilst making sure that that wasn’t going to impact organic search. There’s been a big upside though: people can now navigate by these labels, and they can also be used to target advertising.</p> <p>The site also now has a totally editable framework, drag and drop page creation with modular components and WYSIWIG creation of articles, so it's much easier to change the site and publish new content. Previously developers had to be involved in all of these processes. What's more, managing native and programmatic advertising has become much simpler.</p> <p>One example of the benefits of the new site was when an article on black holes, published a decade earlier, received 10x the number of page views in one week than it had in the previous 3 years after black holes had featured in the news. This was down to how much easier it was after the rebuild for visitors to find relevant, evergreen content, which Physics World has a lot of because of the nature of the subject matter.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-physicsworld-article.jpg\" alt=\"A Physics World article on black holes\"> <figcaption>Physics World's successful article on black holes</figcaption> </figure> <h3>Dens had some takeaways for anyone also thinking about revamping their website:</h3> <ul> <li>Think carefully about how to organise your content in a way that’s relevant to your users (and advertisers) - content is still very much king.</li> <li>Every action you take needs to be geared towards the relevant KPIs – people don’t give you a lot of money to not move the business forward, and…</li> <li>Be brave and don’t worry about getting a bit of negative feedback. Some people just hate change.</li> </ul> <p>The results show that the redesign has generated a lot of real value for Physics World.</p> <h3>Unpacking SUITCASE’s success</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-linda-blank.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Blank\"> <figcaption>Linda Blank, Commercial Director, SUITCASE Media Group</figcaption> </figure> <p>Up next was Linda Blank, Commercial Director of SUITCASE Media Group, an award-winning travel media company with, again, a quarterly print magazine as well as a digital offering. She started on a positive note, pushing back against the prophets of doom: print isn’t dead and publishing isn’t dying. Digital publishing is predicted to grow by 12% by 2020. That’s actually faster than the travel industry that SUITCASE operates within. And, although overall print sales for magazines are declining, independent magazine subscriptions grew by 78% in revenue in 2016. There seems to be a great future for high-quality, well-targeted content.</p> <p>That’s certainly the view that SUITCASE take – they’re aimed at an aspirational, experiential traveller with a “millennial mindset”. This audience doesn’t want a run-of-the-mill experience at another Four Seasons. Catering for them means having differentiated content with a perspective that can't just be found anywhere. That’s true for most audiences these days: it’s often pretty clear why a publisher is struggling when you read its output. If you could read it in 10 other places, why would people pay to read it or advertisers pay premium rates to feature alongside it?</p> <h3>Ads are going native</h3> <p>Great content still needs to be monetised though, and how advertisers spend money is evolving. Linda pointed everyone’s attention in the direction of native advertising and content marketing. This is now a huge industry, she said, projected to be worth $300 billion in 2019. Publishers can work with that.</p> <p>Not only do SUITCASE do native advertising on the site, they’ve also launched their own content marketing agency. This was actually created in response to client demand. Brands were already coming to them and asking “how should we decide on our social strategy” and “how should we write content”. Then, an advertising client said they needed to rebrand themselves and asked SUITCASE to do it for them. They wanted a new tone of voice, and SUITCASE’s output resonated with them. This all flowed directly from being an expert and thought leader in travel.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-suitcase-native.png\" alt=\"Suitcase Group - Native Advertising and Content Marketing\"></figure> <p>Content marketing is also beginning to blend with e-commerce – a great example is <a href=\"https://www.hodinkee.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hodinkee</a>, whose luxury watch blog content has also become a way to reach customers for those watches. Linda said that this is a very cost effective way to find new customers and retain them.</p> <h3>Offline can’t be an afterthought</h3> <p>Linda was also adamant that offline is not just a channel for diversifying revenue, it’s an essential part of their business. Print is a luxury product, and that’s what makes it a precise fit with their online audience. SUITCASE Media actually wouldn’t exist without SUITCASE Magazine’s role in building the audience, and the magazine buffs the thought-leadership credentials that SUITCASE Media needs. It’s a business card for the agency side of the business, and one that generates income: you can bring it to meetings, leave it when you go, and leave a powerful example of your expertise with a potential customer.</p> <p>Offline also isn’t just the magazine – SUITCASE recently did a pop-up bar with Horizn Studios, and partnered with Muji to design their new store windows. In another indication of the power of becoming a thought leader, Muji actually approached them, even though SUITCASE had no history with this sort of project. It’s not a coincidence that Muji roughly translates to ‘quality’ in Japanese, and they loved SUITCASE's approach to travel.</p> <p>The idea behind all of these projects was to create valuable interactions with users, which Linda said is the secret to growing a loyal audience and creating a great community. If you can do that, it becomes a lot easier to monetise users. Asked about how to do that, Linda responded that one of the keys for them is rewarding highly engaged readers, e.g. with events, competitions and providing free products from partners. They also really listen to feedback and comments from members of their community, SUITCASE Club, and act on them, e.g. by updating reviews when members give them new information.</p> <p>Currently SUITCASE are focussing on trying to fix the customer experience of travel, which is very disjointed. There are lots of different sites for research, booking etc., and it’s a chore for travellers. SUITCASE have developed the ‘travel planner’ which allows you to explore different cities, populated with recommendations, and make your own itinerary – basically a personal travel guide that you’ve created yourself. Check it out <a href=\"https://suitcasemag.com/planner\">here</a>.</p> <h3>Linda summed everything up by saying:</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-smp01-suitcase-takeaways.png\" alt=\"Suitcase Group - Key Take Aways\"></figure> <p>It doesn't seem to be a coincidence that both Physics World and SUITCASE have successful print offerings. It might not be crucial for generalised content, but in a well-defined vertical where your specialist content is valuable to a loyal community, print might even have an increasing role - both as a luxury object for readers and as a 'business card' for commercial clients.</p> <p>We hope this was a useful insight into the approaches behind the success of two great digital publishers - stay tuned for the next instalment from SMDP, featuring the panel discussion.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>We're more likely to click on an image than plain text, so make sure your related posts pack a visual punch.</p> <!--more--> <p>Bibblio’s <em>Related Posts for WordPress</em> has become the much-discussed new kid on the block of content recommendation plugins. Its use of AI to constantly monitor and select the most appropriate content suggestions to appear below site posts has set it apart from the raft of predecessors that have saturated this increasingly important area of audience retention.</p> <p>Alongside the AI, Bibblio’s plugin boasts a slickly-designed, customizable module, with many controls to determine how it looks and behaves. Literally hundreds of combinations are available to the WordPresser, from the layout of the recommendation tiles, to the text’s font and size, to the interaction effects.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-builder.gif\" alt=\"The Related Posts for WordPress plugin's module designer\"> <figcaption>The Related Posts for WordPress plugin's module designer</figcaption> </figure> <p>What makes the most impact though are the images used on the module. These are vital in attracting the reader’s eye, encouraging them to discover more and stay on your site.</p> <p>Here are 4 tips to make the most of imagery on your Bibblio Related Posts plugin...</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. Be sure your images are set as Featured Images</h2> <p>Featured Images are a standardized way to assign a primary visual element to your posts. The majority of WordPress templates support Featured Images (also known as post thumbnails) which allow third party plugins such as Bibblio’s to use them for other purposes.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-featured.jpg\" alt=\"Featured Images\"> <figcaption>The Featured Image dialog</figcaption> </figure> <p>If you do not have any images appearing in your Related Posts module, it is possible you aren’t using Featured Images. But fear not, you can use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-featured-images/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Stehle’s Quick Featured Images plugin</a> to bulk-update your posts with Featured Images. The premium version of Martin’s plugin gives you more control over the operation, with plenty of tools to achieve the best result.</p> <p>When your posts update with the Featured Image change, the Related Posts plugin will see the update too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>2. Provide alternatives for posts that have no images</h2> <p>You might have posts that don’t have images in them, be they Featured Images or otherwise. This is fair enough - it might be an article that didn’t require illustration, or it might be a post containing embedded video or audio playback objects that were visually impacting enough. This will mean that you’ll see gray tiles representing these posts in the Related Posts module. They will work sure enough but they won’t be very impactful.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-missing.jpg\" alt=\"A post without a Featured Image would display a gray pattern on the module\"> <figcaption>A post without a Featured Image would display a gray pattern on the module</figcaption> </figure> <p>A solution to this is to add some generic images to the backgrounds of your Related Posts module tiles. That way, if a Featured Image is missing, the tile will show a default image instead of the gray background.</p> <p>Say your website follows a football team - you could have a generic image of their stadium, one of the team, one of a close-up of the badge, one of the mascot geeing up the crowds, etc. If the images are ambiguous enough they will probably work with any post subject.</p> <p>Do this by adding some CSS to either one of your pre-existing stylesheets or by creating a new one. Be sure your stylesheet loads after the Related Posts plugin’s stylesheet (bib-related-content.css) so that it overwrites the plugin’s default class properly.</p> <p>Choose up to six pictures that you've not used as Featured Images before (and don't plan to in the future!) Choosing six and keeping them 'reserved' ensures no image repeats in the same module. Crop these images to a similar ratio to your Featured Images, resizing them to around 500px wide and compressing them so they aren’t too heavy, then save them to your site.</p> <p>Add the following class for each of your tiles, changing the class number to correspond with each tile (e.g. .bib__tile--1, .bib__tile--2 etc.) and the URL to the path for each image, for example:</p> <pre>.bib__tile--1 .bib__link { background-image: url('https://images.bibblio.org/bkgds/demos/publishing-virtual.jpg'); } .bib__tile--2 .bib__link { background-image: url('https://images.bibblio.org/bkgds/demos/publishing-laptop.jpg'); } </pre> <p>etc.</p> <p>If you want to put the cherry on top, add the following class to your stylesheet. The black gradient behind the tile titles are darker when there's a Featured Image and lighter on the gray empty tiles, for better text legibility. This class will ensure the gradient is dark enough for all tiles:</p> <pre> .bib__link .bib__info { background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,1) 100%); background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%,rgba(0,0,0,1) 100%); background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%,rgba(0,0,0,1) 100%); filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient( startColorstr='#00000000', endColorstr='#000000',GradientType=0 ); } </pre> <p>Save the CSS file and reload a post page that you know to have related post suggestions without images. You should see your new default images displaying in those gaps.</p> <p>If you’d prefer not to use replacement images but instead would like to change the gray background for a different color, you can do so by ignoring the preceding classes and using the following code in your CSS, replacing the hex code with a color of your choice:</p> <pre>.bib__link { background-color: #FF9999; } </pre> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>3. Be sure your module shows off your images effectively</h2> <p>For the majority of layouts used on the Related Posts plugin, the module builder allows you to set the ratio of all of the tiles. The choice is <strong><em>4:3</em></strong> (a standard landscape postcard-like size), <strong><em>Square</em></strong> (both width and height are equal) and <strong><em>Wide</em></strong> (16:9 widescreen size).</p> <p>Each of these sizes will influence how your posts’ Featured Images will display in the tiles. For example, if you have widescreen-shaped images and choose Square ratio tiles, the image will display centred in each tile with the left and right edges cropped off the sides. If you have square-shaped images and choose 4:3 ratio tiles, the image will fit in each tile with an effect auto-applied to blend it into the left and right sides.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-ratios.png\" alt=\"How Featured Images display with the plugin's module designer settings\"> <figcaption>How Featured Images display with the plugin's module designer settings</figcaption> </figure> <p>Playing around with these ratios will reveal the best combination. Other factors such as post title length may also influence which ratio works best. For instance, a square ratio allows more text to be displayed, so would suit a site that invariably uses long titles.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-portrait.png\" alt=\"Toggle 'Using portrait images' on if all of your images are that shape\"> <figcaption>Toggle 'Using portrait images' on if all of your images are that shape</figcaption> </figure> <p>Some sites use portrait shaped images (where the width is less than the height), which will create vertical letter-boxing on ratios such as 4:3 and square. This letter-boxing will be disguised by the blending effect, but if you'd prefer your images to fully fit the widths of each tile, go to the <strong>Modules</strong> tab in the Bibblio plugin admin, choose a module to edit and select&nbsp;<strong>“Using portrait images”</strong> from the Display Options panel. This will assume all images on your site are portrait shaped and will resize the images in each tile to fit correctly, anchoring them to the top of the tile. Very useful if all of your Featured Images are book covers!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>4. Be careful your images aren't blurry</h2> <p>It could be that using a particular module makes your background images appear blurry or low quality. This is because the image might be being stretched to fit the larger area of each tile, and here's why...</p> <p>In order to not have the user download high resolution versions of each related post's Featured Image, the plugin instead selects the <em>\"Medium\"</em> sized version. This was one of several default sizes saved by WordPress when you first added the image to your post. WordPress creates a medium-sized image by limiting the width or height (whichever is largest) to a maximum of 300 pixels, scaling the image proportionally.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-using-images-media.png\" alt=\"Increase the dimensions of all future medium-sized images\"> <figcaption>Increase the dimensions of all future medium-sized images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Some of our plugin layouts may have tiles that are wider than 300 pixels in certain instances. The Featured Images are then forced to fit each tile, making them look poor quality.</p> <p>You can ensure a better image quality for all of your <em>future</em> posts, by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Media</strong>, changing the <strong>Medium size</strong> <em>Max Width</em> to 400 and <em>Max Height</em> to 600. Then clicking <strong>Save Changes</strong>. This will make all newly-created medium-sized images slightly larger, even in portrait orientation.</p> <p>If you wish to change the <em>\"Medium\"</em> size of your <em>existing</em> featured images, there are a variety of plugins available to automatically resize them to your desired dimensions. Once complete, you will need to re-import your posts so that Bibblio knows the new image URLs for each. <a href=\"/wp-contact\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Please get in touch</a> if you would like to clear your account to perform this.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>In summary</h2> <p>Play around with the module builder and see what works best for your post images and titles. There will be an ideal layout for you, we're sure! You can even go further and customize the module as much as you like with your own stylesheets. It's your site and your plugin, so make it look as though it has always lived there!

The event's theme was '<strong>Humans, AI, and Decision Making'</strong>&nbsp;- how can we make use of data to help us make better decisions?&nbsp;</p> <p>Isabel Thompson, Senior Strategy&nbsp;Analyst from Holtzbrinck, kicked off the evening with her insights into this area.&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO Mads Holmen had the pleasure of speaking as well, and explored what artificial advice systems can do to help humans make better decisions.</p> <p>Read on to get the highlights of these talks. You can grab their presentation slides too:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>#1 AI has tremendous capabilities, but it's dramatically under-utilised</h2> <p><em>\"AI is an intuition machine that learns through experience, but not like humans do. With these qualities, what can it do?\" - Isabel Thompson</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-IT.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Thompson\"></figure> <p>Companies in pretty much every industry, including publishing, say that they're unsure what to do with AI. Isabel pointed out that, when talking to other strategists and business owners about using AI, the most common problems she comes across are all <em>strategic</em> - not technical:</p> <ul> <li>Competing investment priorities</li> <li>Unclear use cases</li> <li>Unknown ROI</li> <li>Not enough, poor or siloed data</li> <li>Un-agile organizational set-ups</li> <li>A lack of data scientists and tech talent</li> </ul> <p>In order to get anywhere with AI, she said companies need to address these types of problem first. To do this, it helps to know what the immense potential of AI is. To look at it in more depth, Isabel used PWC's great <a href=\"https://irpaai.com/AI2017-recap-NY/resources/Anand_Rao.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">visualisation</a>, which shows how AI’s different fields, capabilities, and applications fit together:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-AIpossibilities.png\" alt=\"SSP18\"></figure> <h2>#2 Don't invest in 'AI'. Invest in solving a business problem.&nbsp;</h2> <p><em>\"AI can do a lot of stuff. But you need a business case, and AI is not always the answer.\" - Isabel Thompson</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>---</em></p> <p>AI is a tool, and there’s a lot of hype around it. Isabel stressed in her talk it should be evaluated like all other tools. Is it actually the best thing for the job?&nbsp;</p> <p>If you look at where companies globally are getting meaningful benefits from AI, she mentioned, you tend to find that they are using it in the core part of their “value chain”. Isabel showed us the below image from&nbsp;McKinsey, highlighting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Advanced%20Electronics/Our%20Insights/How%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/MGI-Artificial-Intelligence-Discussion-paper.ashx\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">four areas in the value chain</a> where AI can really help:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-valuechain.png\" alt=\"Value chain\"></figure> <p>On the revenue-generating impact side of things, there is a lot you can do to improve discoverability, sales and marketing, e.g. better prediction of demand, advertising, and article recommendations. AI also has an impact on the cost-cutting and efficiency side of things; it can help with production costs, supply-chain management, and stocking.</p> <p>Despite all these possibilities, integrating AI effectively into your business will only work for you if you consider these five things (Isabel thanked&nbsp;McKinsey for making <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Advanced%20Electronics/Our%20Insights/How%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/MGI-Artificial-Intelligence-Discussion-paper.ashx\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">these aspects</a> available too):</p> <ol> <li>Do you have the right business case?</li> <li>Are you building a data ecosystem?</li> <li>Have you got the right tools and techniques?</li> <li>Are you integrating AI throughout your workflows?</li> <li>Are you adopting an open culture and reskilling your workforce?</li> </ol> <h2>#3 Recommendations are a key area for exploiting AI</h2> <p><em>\"For a long time, publishing was about printing and distribution. It's now about filtering and curation.\" - Mads Holmen</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-Mads.jpg\" alt=\"Mads Holmen\"></figure> <p>As mentioned in highlight #2, article recommendations and promoting the right products to people are a key application of AI. With recommender engines, techniques like natural language processing, classification and ranking can be used to come up with the best suggestions for e.g. what to read next.&nbsp;</p> <p>Improving the discoverability of the content, Mads explained, boosts the loyalty of your consumers. Every visit to your page or platform is an opportunity to deepen a user's bond with your brand using content. A consumer or reader who bounces because they hit a dead-end is a missed opportunity.&nbsp;</p> <p>So makes a good recommendation? All recommendations will be based on one of three approaches (or a blend of them), Mads explained. They'll be based on the content, on the audience behaviour and/or the&nbsp;individual&nbsp;preferences and goals:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-ingredientsrecs.png\" alt=\"The ingredients of a good recommendation\"></figure> <h2>#4 To make AI work, think differently about competitive advantage, partnerships and vendor relationships&nbsp;</h2> <p><em>\"The way publishers are creating value is changing. For example, discoverability, TDM, analytics and author services are now key parts of publisher offerings, when they weren’t at all even a decade ago.&nbsp;AI will exacerbate these kinds of changes.\" - Isabel Thompson</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p>AI means that developing and sustaining competitive advantage will increasingly be driven by data, Isabel explained. This means that access to unique or privileged data sets that your competitors don’t have will be critical: this data enables you to generate unique insights, products, and services.</p> <p>Unfortunately, lots of data is siloed across - and within - vendors, publishers, research institutions and all the rest. This means no one organisation is going to have all the data it would like to. This means two things, according to Isabel:</p> <ol> <li>Publishers will need to be more creative and open with partnerships, also with 'frenemies'</li> <li>As&nbsp;most AI talent sits with vendors, publishers need to work with consultants and vendors to figure out&nbsp;what might be possible for their businesses</li> </ol> <p>Working closely with other publishers (highlight #1) could bring the pleasures of browsing a site like Wikipedia to all consumers. Mads said: \"<em>Why can't we have consumers discover content across publishers' sites? Why is it that Google, Facebook and Amazon have run away with the whole buffet and we, the publishers, just fight over the fruit bowl? </em></p> <p><em>\"More publishers see the value of working together with 'competitors' over buying traffic from a platform like Facebook, because consumers coming in from other quality content sites are more engaged and add more to the bottom line too:</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-syndication.png\" alt=\"Syndication\"></figure> <p>Regarding highlight #2, Mads, as an 'AI vendor', talked about why you might choose to purchase an AI solution if you were a publisher looking to power recommendations:</p> <p><em>\"It’s possible to build a recommender system yourself, if you’ve got 18 to 24 months and the budget to hire machine learning PhDs. You wouldn’t build your own web-hosting architecture though - it just doesn’t pay to reinvent the wheel.\"</em></p> <h2>Thank you note - and the presentation slides</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-SSP18-TC.jpg\" alt=\"TC\"></figure> <p>It was a pleasure to attend the Society of Scholarly Publishing event to hear Isabel and Mads share their expertise and network over drinks.<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Tom Ciavarella from Clarivate Analytics was a brilliant organiser, and</span>&nbsp;the Work.Life&nbsp;offices were a great venue and host.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you enjoyed the highlights in this blog post, why not grab the slides of Isabel's keynote <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-07-05-SSP-Isabel_Thompson.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and learn more on defining an AI strategy?&nbsp;Interested in what recommendations can do for publishing?

In education, recommendation has recently been lumped under the label of ‘adaptive learning’, and as well as helping you understand what Bibblio is I'll explain a bit about the differences and similarities between us and what adaptive learning companies do.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-discoveringproblem.png\" alt=\"Bibblio - Solving the discovery problem\"></figure> <h3>A million to one?</h3> <p><em>\"We now live in a world where there are millions and millions of pieces of content. Often a learner is trying to find information via a smartphone screen, and we can maybe show them three items at a time - maybe 10 things at a time – but not a million things at a time. So how do we filter this vast amount of information down to something that is digestible?</em></p> <h3>10 billion hours a week</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-hours.png\" alt=\"Recommender systems are everywhere!\"></figure> <p><em>\"We’re going to look to some of the world’s biggest content platforms for inspiration. Every week, people around the world spend more than 10 billion hours on Facebook, Spotify, Netflix and YouTube. At the heart of all of these platforms sits a recommendation system: a system that suggests content to that user based on their past behavior, based on the general behaviour on the platform, and perhaps based on some of the metadata insights that they have on the platform. What does that mean for learning? Apart from the fact that that’s 10 billion hours not spent learning mostly.</em></p> <h3>Educating in a vacuum?</h3> <p><em>\"The first challenge we have to consider is that education doesn't exist in isolation. Just because we have some of the kids's time in school doesn’t change the fact that we want to keep them interested in learning in the outside world. We’re beginning to see people enlisting technology to try and do that. One way of doing that is with ‘adaptive learning’.</em></p> <h3>Adapting to new realities</h3> <p><em>\"What does that actually mean? Think of adaptive learning as a curriculum driven approach to recommendation. You're trying to get a child to a certain stage, or to pass a certain test or to get to a certain level of skill, and you're trying to optimize the content, the resources and the interventions to get them to that point most effectively.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-SDL.png\" alt=\"Adaptive vs self-determined learning\"></figure> <h3>Heading in the right direction</h3> <p><em>\"However that's not the only type of learning that we do. At some point over the course of your school career, and especially beyond, you start to engage in self-directed learning. Even in school, not everything you do is about passing a test. A lot is, but hopefully not everything, and in the future less and less will be. In any kind of self-determined part of the learning journey, like research, recommender systems become very important. How do you find the right information?</em></p> <h3>Give me a place to search from…</h3> <p><em>\"Counter-intuitively, one of the challenges with a tool like Google today is that it’s adapting to us. My girlfriend is experiencing the challenges this presents at the moment. She's retraining to become a developer, and trying to learn by yourself is really difficult using Google in the beginning, because Google doesn't think you're a developer. We did a comparison between her results and those of one of the guys on our team who's been a developer for 10 years. If they Google the same thing, they get very different results because Google doesn't think she's interested in stack overflow. Google really is a recommendation engine, but it suffers from the problem of over-personalization. Since 2009, Google hasn't had an objective search result. Even if you go in incognito and you're not logged in, they still look at 36 data points to figure out what to show you. So we need ways to avoid these ‘filter bubbles’ and reductive personalization.</em></p> <h3>Where Bibblio comes in</h3> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-discoveryloyalty.png\" alt=\"Recommendations improves discovery and loyalty\"></figure> <p><em>\"So where Bibblio comes in is helping content platforms, course platforms, research platforms trying to match content to users more effectively. We know that recommendations improve discovery but they also improve things like motivation and loyalty. If I come to a platform and that platform's good at helping me find the right stuff, the likelihood is that I’ll come back to that platform again and that I’ll begin to develop a relationship with that platform. The opposite is also true: if I arrive and I have a 90s online experience and I can't find anything, what is the likelihood that I'll come back again? As I’ve said, the education system doesn't live in a vacuum from the rest of the world: people bring their expectations of technology and software into the classroom. So, if I'm used to having these great experiences on Netflix or Google etc., that's what I expect in the classroom.</em></p> <h3>What next?</h3> <p><em>\"Once the user has found something how do we most effectively show them what else they could be doing? For example, “here are the most cited resources”, “here are the most used resources”, “here are the ones most related to what you are doing at the moment”. You need to be able give people maybe three or four relevant choices. To give a real life example, Bibblio operates on OpenLearn (the Open University online portal). So, when you reach the end of a page other content you might like is shown that’s driven by Bibblio. If we do our job really well, we're a bit like the referee in football: no-one will ever notice us.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-OpenLearn.png\" alt=\"OpenLearn and Bibblio\"></figure> <h3>Business goals</h3> <p><em>\"OpenLearn's mission as part of the Open University is to extend the use of their educational resources to as many people as possible, and has two functions. It's both to publish all of those resources for the public, but also to recruit students to the Open University. So this goes back to the early stages of the learning journey: how do we actually create the motivation to become a learner? How does that work on OpenLearn? People tend to go from casually visiting the platform, to signing up to one of these very informal free courses, and then becoming a full time student at the Open University. In fact, that happens several thousand times a year. The societal benefits of someone taking that course of action and changing the trajectory of their life in this way is quite substantial. It also has a very very positive contribution to the Open University's business, but that's a whole other side of this story.</em></p> <h3>Why Bibblio?</h3> <p><em>\"What Bibblio really offers is a combination of AI smarts and plug and play recommendations. You can drop a tag, a piece of code, onto the page and we go and read that page to understand what the content is about. We do a full natural language processing to connect those resources to each other and then you can build modules which recommend content to users. Machine learning algorithms power those recommendations to make sure they’re, relevant, popular, and, if you want, recent.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-plugnplay.png\" alt=\"Plug n Play AI for recommendation and personalization\"></figure> <h3>What would you recommend?</h3> <p><em>\"So the next question is what exactly is a good recommendation? In short: it's not one thing. If you look at e.g. Netflix, they deploy about 130 different algorithms to figure out what to show to people. We don't have quite that many, but that's okay: they've been doing it since 2006. Even with all those algorithms, they can essentially be grouped into three areas.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-3corealgo.png\" alt=\"The platform provides 3 core algorithm products\"></figure> <p><em>\"The first is content based (based on understanding the content). If I'm doing research and I've found an article about lakes in Africa, the likelihood is that I'm on a journey where I'm trying to find out more about that, and unsurprisingly, we've seen is that there's a really strong connection between search and recommendation. What we see on platforms like Student Room etc. is that someone will come in search for 'biology' then find some search results, come back about six minutes later and search for 'mitochondria', because now they've realized that actually biology is this massive term, and then they come back maybe even a third or a fourth time and refine their search. So one of the really fascinating things about learning, quoting Donna Martins, is that search is great if you know what you're looking for. But the problem in learning is often we don't actually know what we're looking for yet and that's where recommendation comes in.</em></p> <h3>A digital librarian?</h3> <p><em>\"The name Bibblio comes from bibliotheque, the library, and the idea of the librarian is really important. In the classic scenario, the librarian is the person who helps guide you to what you might not know yet, but on these digital platforms that we can operate 24 hours a day, who's the librarian? So that's really where recommender systems sit in the world: think of us like a digital librarian trying to help people find the right thing. Just like a librarian knows you personally, the second group of algorithms are behavior based. The reality is that some learning resources are better than others, and through looking at user behavior we can begin to identify the resources that seem to do a good job at a certain point in the journey. If students land there do they spend a significant amount of time? Do they leave again really quickly? Those are some of the signals that we can pick up and respond to. We can also monitor what you’ve already read or consumed: there's no reason to suggest that to you again.</em></p> <h3>Hidden patterns</h3> <p><em>\"But it also gets more advanced, because we can begin to see your patterns of behavior. How are you similar to other people? One of the really fascinating ideas that I have in this space that we haven't actually been able to deploy yet is that you can also recommend people as well as content. So what if we could identify students and say “Actually you've read all this stuff, and you've read all that stuff, but you guys haven't really read much of the same so maybe you should talk to each other?” It's really a very open use case which is both good but also sometimes challenging for us. Personalisation is certainly a third element of this, but it also opens up discussions about filter bubbles and are we showing what people what they already know etc.?</em></p> <h3>Popping bubbles</h3> <p><em>\"That is a bit less of an issue with the Bibblio platform, because we haven't built the platform to optimize for ‘shallow’ engagement. We're not necessarily going to be a great investment for the Daily Mail to drive more page views on their Kim Kardashian articles. But, we know that we can lift the engagement that we see around content resources. Whether it's teachers looking for resources on the National Geographic Education or Show My Homework, where we also feature, or students looking for materials like OpenLearn or Of Course, we actually know that by serving good recommendations to people we can improve the outcomes of that experience. At the heart of all this are things that don’t get mentioned too often in education these days: things like student motivation and teacher motivation.</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-LFL18-numbers.png\" alt=\"We help high-end publishers build engagement\"></figure> <h3>Experience wins</h3> <p><em>\"If I have a great experience with software I tend to want to use that software more, and that's really one of the challenges we have about getting educational technology adopted into the classroom. We need to make that software is a good experience for both students and teachers. That's always the feedback I've heard from the classrooms: if I have to spend 12 minutes logging in and then loading something up on all these screens, it's not going to work. So I think that's the other thing that's really important in this: that it plugs in and it helps deliver a better experience in real time. That’s the future that we hope the Bibblio will contribute to – one where anyone can learn easily in or out of the classroom using technology that loses nothing in comparison to the best content companies out there. And that’s all that we have for you today. I hope it was an insightful little view into the world of recommender systems! Thanks very much for listening.\"</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

The meetup took place at their offices at Thomas More Square, offering a great view of St Katharine Docks.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn05-networking.jpg\" alt=\"Catching up over pizza at the fifth RecSys meetup in London\"></figure> <p>The presenters for the evening were <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jian-li-487ab120/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jian Li</a> (Principal Data Scientist at Sky), <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/preritsouda/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Preriit Souda</a> (Data Science Consultant and Marketeer) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrees/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Rees</a> (Senior Research Engineer at Sky).</p> <p>Read on to get the highlights of their talks, and grab their presentation slides too.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Content discovery using moods</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn05-Jian-Li.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Jian Li\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The first talk of the evening was by Dr. Jian Li, Principal Data Scientist at Sky. He's the manager of the data science team responsible for machine learning research, innovation and product development for Sky's content discovery services.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Jian kicked off his presentation with a short intro. on how recommendation engines play an important role in helping customers to discover content that matches their particular interests. An interesting use case for Sky is to figure out when to promote new (but basically non-viewed) content to customers:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Jian1.png\" alt=\"Dr. Jian Li's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">While they have experimented extensively with a large set of algorithms to improve accuracy, there are still lots of areas to improve. One area Jian is interested in is how to establish natural, smooth and effective communication between customers with their services. His question is how a content discovery service could respond naturally and accurately to a customer’s natural expression, or mood:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Jian2.png\" alt=\"Dr. Jian Li's presentation\"></figure> <p>Mood has two aspects, Jian explained: firstly, it’s the natural expression of a customer’s feelings. For example \"I want to watch something funny\". Secondly, it's the kind of feeling that a piece of content can evoke, i.e. this film will make a customer laugh a lot. The question is how do we connect them.</p> <p>You could hard-code moods like 'funny' into a movie genre, e.g. 'comedy', but this creates some restrictions. On the one hand it's not true that only comedies make you laugh, on the other, a mood like 'exciting' can't be translated into a single genre because lots of things can be exciting. During the project Jian wondered whether they could stop this kind of manual translation and directly rank content by how funny, exciting etc. it is. Here's what he and his team came up with:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Jian3.png\" alt=\"Dr. Jian Li's presentation\"></figure> <p>They started with a number of pieces of content, each associated with a number of keywords describing the nature of the content and also a list of mood labels. They built a model to learn the correlations between moods and keywords. The outcome is a set of semantic representations of moods. Every mood is represented by all keywords and each key word is scored to indicate how relevant it is to a particular moods. If a mood is not relevant, the score will be low (but there'll still be one).</p> <p>The completed content mood profiles gave the team the ability to create a large number of recommendation features. For example, a customer can query one mood, a combination of multiple moods or even adding preferred weights to the combination. For example, \"I want to watch something that's really exciting, somewhat funny and scary too.\" Jian's team is currently working on the UX so the user can query this intuitively.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-06-19-RecSysLDN-Sky_Jian_Li.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Get into the mood and grab Jian's slides</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Knitting data to create a brocade of strategic insights</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn05-Preriit-Souda.jpg\" alt=\"Preriit Souda\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our second speaker was Preriit Souda. He's a data science consultant and marketeer, and has a sophisticated social media analytics toolkit. He and his team have analyzed around 20+ TB(!) of post-processed social media data. In his talk he focused on how you can use metadata to deliver improved customised advertising experiences.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Preriit kicked off his presentation by asking the attendees how much can you find out about a person by looking at just one of their tweets. The answer is quite a lot:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Preriit1.png\" alt=\"Preriit Souda's presentation\"> <figcaption>Slide from Preriit's presentation showing all the data points you can gather based on his 4-word tweet with an image.</figcaption> </figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">As you can see in the above slide, there's mention of different data linkage groups such as image mining and information connected to text, weather, location and demographic attributes. See below for the overview of Preriit's framework. On the right hand side you'll see other data sources you can use, which are not directly linked, but very useful thematical databases to find out more about people who are like your research subject.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Preriit2.png\" alt=\"Preriit Souda's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Preriit is very skeptical about the effectiveness of marketing surveys, and he suggested that using these novel techniques could effectively make them redundant.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">So how can you use this data to solve companies' strategic problems? Preriit spent the last part of his presentation going through a couple of use cases. One of the use cases was a restaurant with falling sales. They used the data sources below to figure out what was going wrong:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Preriit3.png\" alt=\"Preriit Souda's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By analyzing the data (and without having to actually ask anyone directly), they found that the restaurant was struggling to differentiate itself. There were also many questions over its premium pricing in the chatter and review data they picked up. Uncovering these two main issues allowed this client to take informed action.</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">The restaurant kicked off a re-branding exercise and added new, affordable, seasonal dishes to its menu. These had actually been wishes expressed by people online: using data likes this offers a very practical way to help you learn about problems and come up with solutions.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-06-19-RecSysLDN-Preriit_Souda.pptx\" target=\"_blank\">Other use cases and more info on the framework in Preriit's presentation</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Exploring movie posters with neural networks</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn05-Adam-Rees.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Rees\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Last up was Adam Rees, Senior Research Engineer at Sky, discussing his side project: using neural networks to find patterns in the design of movie posters. His work in this space was inspired by a <a href=\"https://uproxx.com/viral/thirteen-movie-poster-cliches-and-what-they-say-about-the-movie/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> he read about movie poster clichés.

On their Cinema platform, the poster images are used as the main navigation as users scan for something to watch:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Adam4.png\" alt=\"Adam Rees's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">With a Coursera course in machine learning under his belt, and interested in finding out more about the make up of Sky's movie poster offering, Adam decided to first have a go at clustering by similarity. He used the final hidden layer of a pre-trained VGG 19 neural network to extract the features which were then used to cluster the movie posters:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Adam5.png\" alt=\"Adam Rees's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">By using the 'tools' Jupyter (Python), Keras and Tensorflow, and the T-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) algorithm, Adam could plot the images in a 2D environment. Here's one of the&nbsp;<span>beautiful&nbsp;</span>first results:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Adam6.png\" alt=\"Adam Rees's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Using the Neural Style Transfer technique to amplify the clustering, Adam identified groups such as posters with as focus point 'dogs', 'Marilyn Monroe characters', 'guys with hats' and 'gangs'. Other major themes were described by him as 'Gritty Crime Dramas', 'Romantic Boxes' and 'Spooky Houses':</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/Blog_5thRecSysLDN_Adam7.png\" alt=\"Adam Rees's presentation\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Adam isn't sure where he will take the project next. An idea suggested in the Q&amp;A was to actually team up with Jian's research team, to discover whether there's a relationship between the imagery and text or mood data allocated to it. Could it help in creating better recommendations or open the pathway towards a personalized movie poster?</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-06-19-RecSysLDN-Sky_Adam_Rees.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about Adam's work with convolutional networks in his presentation</a></p>",

Lele remembers being impressed by the power of systems utilizing \"statistical libraries and primitive Scikit-learn\".</p> <p>He took what he learned to start his own company Deckard, which focused on predictive analytics for project management. Their system would ingest information from the software development team of a client (e.g. from Jira), crunch it and calculate size of tickets for sprint planning and suggest names to work on them, and when, too. Unfortunately, the company didn't last as it proved really hard to fit into the workflow set-ups of companies.</p> <p>Now, Lele focuses on enabling connections between enterprises, startups, investors and engineers at his new company <a href=\"https://beyond-machine.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Machine</a>. His goal is also to increase public understanding and discussion of the implications of machine intelligence. To get the audience thinking more about that space, he brought on Rupert Steffner, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://wunder.ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wunder.ai</a>, and one of the people he works with.</p> <p>Rupert's company offers a B2B service, optimizing the eCommerce experience his clients offer their users. Part of their service includes a product recommender. The most popular use cases are what he described as 'Next Best Offering' and 'Most Similar Item'; the latter being the item you show when end-users are searching for an item that is out of stock.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/RecSysBER_1stMeetup_WunderAI.png\" alt=\"Wunder AI\"></figure> <p>In his short talk he discussed the most common challenges and biases associated with this recommender case study. This included well known issues such as the sparsity problem, but also <em>stability bias</em> where your systems always expect the same behavior of a user over time. As Rupert pointed out, humans are unstable creatures that can change their minds at any time. That's why every year we're spending billions on marketing as a society, he added. Next up was the relevance bias. This describes how many companies mistakenly treat the output of nearest neighbour algorithms as optimized personal preferences.</p> <p>Another well-know bias, which plays a huge part in recommendation experience, is the position or presentation bias. You can't choose what you cannot see. This bias would play a key role in the evening's last presentation about restaurant discovery too. See below for more:</p> <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Recipe of Delicious Recommendations</h2> <p><em>“Well known and popular restaurants receive a substantial number of orders — customers get what they expect and naturally give great ratings. Some customer groups however do not want popular restaurants in their recommendations list.”</em> - Gugu Ncube</p> <p>The last presenter of the evening was Gugu Ncube, Director of Search and Discovery at Delivery Hero. This online food ordering and delivery marketplace maintains a network with more than 150,000 restaurant partners. Delivery Hero is active in more than 40 countries.</p> <p>The company currently handles 1 million orders a day. Gugu kicked off by elaborating the goal of recommendations in the food context: enabling customers to discover new restaurants.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/RecSysBER_1stMeetup_DeliveryHero1.png\" alt=\"Delivery Hero\"></figure> <p>Gugu mentioned that, after trying out different algorithms, the content-based algorithms worked the best for the recommendation and discovery of restaurants. His team created a model which captures passive preferences of customers based on past orders &nbsp;on individual ingredient level, and then ranks the restaurant by the rating it receives for orders that include dishes with those ingredients.</p> <p>Other key factors influencing the recommendations are recency of orders at a particular restaurant, cuisine, time of day and budget. Below is the content algorithm in detail:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-content-based-algorithm.png\" alt=\"Content based algorithm\"></figure> <p>Gugu outlined the architecture and tech stack of their recommender system. He concluded with a captivating discussion on the biggest challenges his team is facing when building great food recommendations:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/RecSysBER_1stMeetup_DeliveryHero3.png\" alt=\"Delivery Hero\"></figure> <p>Data sparsity, also mentioned earlier by Rupert, is one of the main challenges. Customers often repeat orders at the same restaurant - they have very few touch points. As a result, user-based collaborative filtering models produced mostly popular and somewhat random restaurant recommendation. This motivated them to research into content-based algorithms. Early success gave way to other new challenges: inconsistently labelled restaurants meta data. The meta data of dishes such as ingredients and cuisine is typically labeled by restaurant owners. Some restaurant owners may omit characteristics, which they view as insignificant.</p> <p><em>“The cuisine of a restaurant may be labelled simply as \"Asian\". In detail, the restaurant’s focus can be Japanese, Chinese or Singaporean. In certain cases, ingredients are simply not labelled at all. Knowing that a dish is a hamburger is not specific enough for recommendations. What is actually in the Hamburger? Is is beef, chicken or tofu ? We began to extract additional meta data from the menu items in order to create better models.”</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/RecSysBER_1stMeetup_DeliveryHero4.png\" alt=\"Delivery Hero\" style=\"text-align: center; background-color: transparent; color: #777777; font-size: 1.2vmax;\"></p> <p>Popular restaurants and how how to rank them present another challenge. Popular restaurants top quality metrics from ratings to order volumes and positive reviews. This is very popular chains, who already have a large customer base offline:</p> <p><em>\"We discovered a phenomena concerning well-known and popular chains, that most of the customers have eaten from offline too. So when they order from the chain online, they will get the food they expect. Thus the customer will always rate the restaurant disproportionally higher than say a previously unknown restaurant.\"</em></p> <p>The challenge is that, despite being highly rated, some customers will simply never order from those chains. An algorithm which only relies on ratings is liable to suggest popular fast food chains only.</p> <p>Presentation bias affects measured metrics more that expected. The top positions, especially the first position, gets the most clicks and typically has the highest conversion. Hungry customers cannot be expected to be patiently and carefully inspect a list of 200 restaurants fully before making a choice on where to order. The top 10 listed items account to almost 60% of the orders. Deciding the position in which to show each restaurant based on customer relevance is task which is continuously optimized.</p> <p>The another challenge is latest to diversity of food and cuisines depending on a particular country. Through the order volumes and frequency, Gugu found out that Italian restaurants are particularly popular in Germany. This means that Italian restaurants typically get a lot of orders — which however does not mean they automatically better than other restaurants. Restaurants offering other cuisines also need a fair chance to be displayed when browsing for a restaurant nearby:</p> <p><em>“We are working on a/b-tests, in which we &nbsp;show restaurants in alternative sorting orders. In this way we’re trying to counterbalance the existing biases. It’s about giving the restaurants which are normally not shown a chance to be seen by the customer.”</em></p> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-06-05-RecSysBER-Delivery_Hero.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Have a look at all the delicious slides from Gugu's presentation</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">I'm grateful we were able to host our inaugural Berlin event at such an cool and welcoming venue, and it was fun chatting to everyone over drinks and pizza.

The theory's simple premise is that \"I don't shine if you don't shine.\" It's a term Ann coined with Aminatou Sow to describe a commitment to collaborating with rather than competing against other people—especially other women.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber01-grace-dobush.jpg\" alt=\"Grace Dobush\"></figure> <p>Grace's explanation about how The Shine Theory has impacted how she networks, and inspires others to do the same, was my personal highlight of her talk. In a period where the model of publishers banding together to counter the dominance of the duopoly is finding more and more favour, improving your networking skills seems on point.</p> <p>If you're doing networking right, it's fun, said Grace:</p> <p><em>\"It's like meeting up with a co-worker who you don't hate.

A key challenge <a href=\"http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/publications/2018/digital-transition-local-news/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned by the interviewees</a> was \"retaining and attracting of new talent.\" A month later, DigiDay did <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-talent-biggest-obstacle-bringing-media-buying-house/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a study</a> of their own, this time focused on bringing media-buying talent into publishing businesses, and they concluded that acquiring talent is the biggest challenge the European companies which they surveyed face.</p> <p>During this evening's panel, Mads asked Christin what her biggest challenge was when launching Business Insider Germany back in 2015. She didn't have to think about it at all. \"Hiring talent\", she said without hesitation.</p> <p>When Christin was Editor-in-Chief of Business Insider Germany, she was - among other things - tasked to hire a team of writers for the new platform. She found this was the biggest challenge:&nbsp;</p> <p><em>\"Hiring talent is a huge problem in the publishing space. This doesn't mean there are no great people out there, but talent is sparse.\"</em></p> <p>Do you recognize this as a major struggle at your organisation too? Let us know how you deal with this.</p> <h2>#3 \"The industry changed forever when Michael Jackson died and the Arab Spring came - that's when readers became reporters.\" - Brian O'Connor</h2> <p>On the 25th of June, 2009, Michael Jackson died. The King of Pop's death triggered reactions around the world, creating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Michael_Jackson#Public_reaction\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unprecedented surges of Internet traffic</a>. The news spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload. TMZ and the Los Angeles Times suffered outages. Google initially believed that the millions of search requests for Michael Jackson meant their search engine was under DDoS attack. Twitter reported a crash, as did Wikipedia. AOL called it a seminal moment in internet history. They've never seen anything like it in terms of scope or depth.</p> <p>Just over a year later, the Arab Spring began with the Tunisian Revolution. In the wake of the Arab Spring protests, a considerable amount of attention has been focused on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#Social_media_and_the_Arab_Spring\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the role of social media and digital technologies</a> in allowing citizens within areas affected by 'the Arab Uprisings' as a means for collective activism to circumvent state-operated media channels. The use of social media platforms more than doubled in Arab countries during the protests, and a study by the University of North Carolina and the UN Development Program concluded that:</p> <p><em> \"Social media provided new sources of information the regime could not easily control and were crucial in shaping how citizens made individual decisions about participating in protests, the logistics of protest, and the likelihood of success.\"</em></p> <p>In response to Mads's question about what 'more traditional' media businesses could learn from new publishing platforms, Brian described working at Die Welt during the death of Jackson and the Arab Revolutions:</p> <p><em>\"We were clever then and started up a 'news market place', so our audience could dictate the message and tell us what to report and investigate. I haven't seen many big players in Germany do it properly yet. They are more comfortable with buying other media outlets that don't reach new audiences instead of investing in connecting more directly to their audiences.\" </em></p> <p>How do you connect to your readers or members? Do you use social media or other channels to have them share stories or angles with you - or is this a change you don't support?</p> <h2>#4 \"Academic publishing understood early on how to make money in digital - as opposed to news media.\" - Sven Fund</h2> <p>Last year, Stephen Buranyi wrote an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">insightful long-read</a> on the \"staggeringly profitable business\" of scientific publishing. In the piece, Stephen explains that in order to make money, a traditional publisher – say, a magazine – first has to cover a multitude of costs: it pays writers for the articles; it employs editors to commission, shape and check the articles; and it pays to distribute the finished product to subscribers, retailers or platforms such as Facebook. All of this is expensive, and successful magazines typically make profits of around 12-15%.</p> <p>The way to make money from a scientific article looks very similar, except that scientific publishers manage to duck most of the actual costs. Scientists create work under their own direction – funded largely by governments – and give it to publishers for free; the publisher pays scientific editors who judge whether the work is worth publishing and check its grammar, but the bulk of the editorial burden – checking the scientific validity and evaluating the experiments, a process known as peer review, is done by working scientists on a volunteer basis. The publishers then sell the product back to government-funded institutional and university libraries to be read by scientists, who, in a collective sense, created the product in the first place. Sven explains what this means for the margins:</p> <p><em>\"For example Elsevier, the market leader in research publishing, has margins of 40%. Academic publishing is obviously a different world to many others. 'Audience development' is not about a mass of people, but about relevance. It's a continuous challenge for the publishers to help researchers target and reach their peers efficiently and effectively.\" </em></p> <p>Sven sees that academic publishing has many areas in which they can improve working for their audiences:</p> <p><em>\"Academic publishing has been really good at creating products, but really bad at understanding the customer's readers. Many publishers have forgotten that behind these 7,500 academic libraries in the world there are 250 million people in research - or in industry that does research. When I ask publishing houses how their readers behave, who they are and where they are, I don't get a clear answer. So the first attempts at getting a grasp on this, through the use of social media for example, are kicking off.\" </em></p> <h2>#5 \"We need to start taking influencers seriously - we have been underestimating them for quite a while now.\" - Lin Hierse</h2> <p>Publishers are using influencer marketing to bolster branded content programs or stand alone offerings, including consumer research. Earlier this year, the Interactive Advertising Bureau <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/news/top-five-ways-marketers-can-benefit-publisher-influencer-marketing-programs/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published a guide</a> after their working group spoke to member publishers. They identified four key ways influencer marketing is moving the dial for publishers: 1) content creation/curation, 2) content credibility, 3) content amplification and 4) content as an extension of a publisher's thought leadership.</p> <p>Lin emphasized the importance of utilizing influencer marketing for all publishers - established and new. Influencers and the content they can help you create have come a long way too:</p> <p><em>\"The audience is getting smarter. They don't accept shallow and rather baffling attempts to push brands anymore. We've come a long way since the first trashy videos. People talk about influencers in a way they used to talk about bloggers. Newsrooms should start being more open minded towards these kinds of new formats.\"</em></p> <p>Do you get influencers involved in spreading your story? Are you or your journalist colleagues setting out to be more of an influencer?</p> <h2>#6 \"We're now very tolerant of failure - in the winning, experimental sort of way\" - Tom Clark</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-fompber01-tom-clark.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Clark\"></figure> <p>The evening's final talk by Tom was about thinking creatively about the future of publishing, with an especial focus on new product development. He spoke about the importance of the agile method - a particular project management approach that uses incremental, iterative work sequences:</p> <p><em>\"Business models tend to follow a waterfall approach - this usually means you invest far too much in something that's probably not going to stick in this fast-changing world. De Gruyter is trying to work in a more agile way to be able to launch more products and see what sticks.\"</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/social/Blog_1FoMP_agile.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Cheesewright\"> <figcaption>One of the quotes showcased in Tom's presentation.</figcaption> </figure> <p>To my delight, Tom emphasized the value collaborations with startups bring in making better products for end-users:</p> <p><em>\"The startups are the one who are coming in and applying different metrics, slicing and dicing communties and selling those services back to the Luddites that our industry can be. We're partnering increasingly with startups.\"</em></p> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-06-07-FoMPBER-De_Grutyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">See Tom's slides for more great quotes and how De Gruyter is working on user adaption</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p class=\"diversion\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Join the meetup group to not miss out!</span><br> <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Media-Publishing-Berlin/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/logos/events/fomp/ber/FoMP-BER-logo-600px.png\" alt=\"Join the Future of Media &amp; Publishing Berlin\" vspace=\"15\"></a></p>",

    "post_content": "<p>CogX, the festival of all things AI, returned to London last week, bringing with it speakers and companies from around the world to discuss and demonstrate how the potential of this technology is becoming reality.</p> <!--more--> <p>AI is regularly touted as a major disruptive force in practically every industry. In many places that’s still just hype, but in media it’s becoming reality. From <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/02/robots-wrote-this-story/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bots writing sports stories</a> to <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-09-08/netflix-reccomendation-how-does-it-work/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">algorithms choosing what audiences see</a>, this technology is changing the way content is created and distributed.</p> <p>With that in mind, CogX featured a panel&nbsp;<span>this year<span>&nbsp;</span></span>with the intriguing title ‘AI: the threat or cure for media?’. Helmed by tech media stalwart Mike Butcher, Editor-at-large for TechCrunch, the panel was made up of Grace Boswood (COO, Design and Engineering at the BBC), Dan Gilbert (Director of Data for News UK), and Bibblio’s Mads Holmen. We were there to bring you some of the highlights of the discussion:</p> <h2>Data transformation in the media</h2> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\"><span>Mike kicked things off by asking Dan about the rapid changes in the industry from his viewpoint at News UK. Was it fair to suggest that most media organisations have only recently woken up to the fact that they are sitting on vast troves of valuable data, and are they now trying to become tech companies?</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">Dan agreed that things have really begun to change in the last few years. When he got into journalism 5-6 years ago, things were very analytics focussed and the emphasis was on trying to work out who was buying what. By comparison, in the last 2-3 years it’s been much more about helping journalists use the data they have about content, which had previously been impossible.</span></p> <h2>Practical applications of AI in the newsroom</h2> <p>Mike was curious to what extent the use of algorithms and AI had actually supercharged content consumption. Grace’s immediate reply was that it wasn’t just a case of supercharging things: as recently as 12 months ago on iPlayer, when you watched an episode of Top Gear you were asked ‘do you want to watch this episode again’. Whilst that might work for your three year old child, adults aren’t so keen on watching the same thing over and over.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“12 months ago, I kid you not, on iPlayer, when you watched an episode of Top Gear we asked you ‘Do you want to watch this episode again?’”</em></p> <p>Beyond the simple fixes like this, there’s also a need to make the content journey even more sophisticated, because if the BBC doesn’t then other people will, and audiences will choose their platform instead. Grace mentioned Netflix as a company that stands out as doing that very effectively.</p> <p><span>She also pointed out that the BBC’s unusual status, with a public service mandate, meant that they had distinct aims when it came to working on content recommendation. On terrestrial television, the news would always follow Eastenders because it helped encourage the large audience that tuned in for that to take an interest in current affairs. It was the BBC’s aim to take this kind of thinking into algorithm development as well – how can recommender systems help encourage civic engagement, as well as clicks?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">Dan said that at News UK, AI is now helping at all stages of the content life cycle, from editors and journalists planning what to cover to then trying to get more people to read it via recommendations. A fundamental change is that technology has appeared in the last couple of years which allows marketing approaches like audience segmentation to be applied to the newsroom. This has now advanced to the stage where AI is on the cusp of helping with e.g. headline writing, but there’s still definitely a spirit of experimentation.</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“We’re trying lots of things, and it’s all pretty nuanced”</em></p> <h2>Skepticism in editorial</h2> <p>Mike asked about the problem of cultural pushback from editorial teams when this data-led approach began to emerge. Dan reiterated that things really have changed in the last few years: there’s been a dramatic shift and there’s now a lot of enthusiasm. This is partly because teams are now much more collaborative.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“it’s not data scientists, in a bunker, trying to solve problems, it’s data scientists trying to work with the editors and journalists”</em></p> <p>Grace agreed that there has been a rapid cultural shift from data almost being viewed as an enemy to now very firmly being viewed as a friend. Content creators don’t like being directed, and there had been a definite mood of “Stop weaponizing data! We know our audiences!” That’s changed. There’s an acceptance that data can enable a more audience-centric perspective and has a role in connecting the various part of the BBC.</p> <h2>Limitations of AI in the media</h2> <p>Mike was curious where the panel saw things heading. Mads said that while it was clear that personalization had become the Holy Grail for many content businesses, there were increasing signs of pushback. Over-personalization, e.g. in recommendations, led to narrow horizons. As one of his friends recently confessed about logging into personalized social media, he’s often disappointed to see “my own, unimaginative self staring back at me”.</p> <p>The fact is, even when content businesses have enough data to personalize services, using it to send someone on a binge, a la Youtube, will ultimately be unproductive if the user begins to have negative feelings about their usage habits.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“(Some algorithms) optimize to the data we have, but maybe not the right data”</em></p> <p>Mads pointed out that whilst trying to ‘hack’ attention looks successful in the short-term for an ad business, at some point visitors are likely to want to grow as people, and they’re going to want more from you. Even Gen. Z’ers, who’ve never seen a non-algorithmic world, are growing increasingly aware of the problem of going down content rabbit holes. They will get sick of shallow experiences. With the algorithms we have&nbsp;<span>at the moment<span>&nbsp;</span></span>, it’s hard to detect when that moment is getting close.</p> <p><span>Mads’ belief is that this is the next frontier: how can we begin to really capture what people want and how does media fit into their lives to help them achieve that.</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“(Current algorithms) don’t capture the emotional aspect of being a human and consuming content.”</em></p> <p>Grace agreed, and added that algorithms don’t just personalize, they also optimize for the business model. Many of the big tech players businesses are built on driving time spent, and the way to drive time spent is to send a visitor into a filter bubble so they carry on consuming content. That’s the way many businesses have built their fortunes, but it’s a pretty questionable practice.</p> <p>She was adamant that there is an opportunity for other businesses if they can create distinctive experiences which are, frankly, founded on different business principles. The BBC really sees a role for itself in that world, not being driven by time spent but by value added for users, and how people feel about the experience you’re giving them.</p> <h2>Buzzword Bingo: Blockchain!</h2> <p>With the current hype around blockchain and cryptocurrencies subsiding but very much still around, Mike asked whether those technologies would have role in deciding which content people do and don’t end up consuming. Will blockchain and crypto mean that algorithms incentivise readers to look at what they’re paid to read?</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">“Crypto, blockchain, data science, AI all get bundled into one thing…”</em></p> <p>Dan and Grace were fairly skeptical about the possibility that blockchain and crypto would be serious influences on audiences media consumption, and Dan pointed out there’s a lot of confusion around how they belong together, or don’t…</p> <p>Mads was more positive about the idea, but cautioned that for the moment there was little sign of adoption beyond a core of die-hard tech fans. Citing the crypto token BAT, that had been built to deliver micropayments to people in exchange for their attention, he pointed out that there’s an experience problem.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Actually using these products isn’t always a very delightful experience. Until we can lower that barrier it’s not going to scale beyond a certain group.”</em></p> <p>The evening ended with two contrasting takes on where AI and media is headed:</p> <p>Dan emphasised that with the field developing so quickly, it can be naïve to make grand predictions about how things will change in the newsroom.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“As AI and machine learning are evolving and evolving, the way you introduce it never really stands still.”</em></p> <p>Grace cautioned that getting journalists to really understand and engage with the new technology is still a work in progress, given that using data has only recently become par for the course. AI isn’t about to replace content creators just yet.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“There is the magic in editorial voices, and it’s very, very unlikely in the near term that those are going to get replaced.”</em></p>",

    "post_content": "<p>We discovered how recommendations are helping people get their daily dose of music, news and food</p> <!--more--> <p>At Bibblio Events we recently organized our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RecSys-New-York-City/events/247768271/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">first-ever RecSys New York City Meetup</a>, hosted by the team at eBay. The data science get-together took place at their offices in Chelsea, Manhattan, on 6th Avenue.</p> <p>The presenters for the evening were Adam Hajari (Senior Scientist at Pandora) &amp; Samir Rayani (Engineer at Pandora), Dhaval Shah (Head of Machine Learning and Big Data Engineering at Bloomberg Media) and Marc Jansen (Data Scientist at Gousto).</p> <p>Read on to find out more about the work they've been doing to improve recs at their companies and grab the links to their presentation slides too.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>Eightball: an Open-source Framework</h2> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We sat around and thought: could we reverse engineer the Billboards charts? And you know, as college kids, we said 'probably'.\"</i> – Samir Rayani</p> </blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p>Samir Rayani co-founded Next Big Sound (NBS) in 2008 during his junior year at Northwestern University, and Adam Hajari joined the company in 2012 after completing a PhD in Physics at Washington University. In 2015, NBS was acquired by Pandora, which offers an internet radio service, available in the US, which is well known for its track recommendation feature.</p> <p>After an intro on how NBS came about - a group of college kids asking themselves '<em>how does a band become famous?</em>' - Samir explained the underlying principle and purpose of their RecSys problem space in their duo presentation.</p> <p>NBS focuses on finding out where fans are listening to artists, analyzing that data to determine which social signals lead to sales, and ultimately recommending to artists and their teams which marketing levers they can pull to increase their sales and grow their audience. Here's the premise of NBS set out in a diagram:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide01.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>Before diving into <em>eightball</em>, Samir and Adam shared some entertaining and valuable insights that they picked up in the early years at NBS. They spoke about how important it was to learn lessons the hard way:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide02.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>So how did they get to where they are now? A new hire introduced <a href=\"https://12factor.net/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the twelve-factor methodology</a> to NBS's engineering and data science team, and the first factor is a 'version controlled code base'.</p> <p>Another factor is 'Build, Release, Run', so NBS packaged all their apps as a single file that included all library dependencies. This is the connection to eightball, Adam explained, which attempts to do something similar for models:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide03.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>Eightball uses panda dataframes as its data structure, and in a way wraps the Scikit-learn library whilst adding extra tools. In short, their open-source python library can be used for packaging prediction classifiers and evaluation tools (and can be <a href=\"https://github.com/nextbigsoundinc/eightball\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found on GitHub here</a>).</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-25-RecSysNYC-Pandora.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shake the magic eightball for more insights in their slides</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>News Recommendations at Scale: Challenges and Approaches</h2> <blockquote> <p><i>\"People don't want to read about yesterday's market breakdown today. Most stories we can't recommend a couple of weeks later, not even a couple of hours later - we need to do it right now.\"</i> – Dhavel Shah</p> </blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p>Next up was Dhaval Shah, who has been has been Head of Machine Learning and Big Data Engineering at Bloomberg Media for close to four years now.</p> <p>Dhaval came to talk about doing recommendations at scale, and the numbers over at Bloomberg Media back that up: every month they reach <strong>60 million unique visitors</strong> on web and mobile applications by publishing approximately <strong>500 news stories and videos every day.</strong></p> <p>In the image below you can see of how the user sees their recommendations. Article recommendations are presented in a never-ending scroll - this works similarly across desktop and mobile.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide04.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>The team at Bloomberg Media, Dhaval explains, wants to continuously enhance the UX, increase the amount of time users spend on their platforms, and grow the group of returning users too. He expressed the belief of both the data science team and 'business' side that personalizing their news content will help them achieve these goals.</p> <p>What are the challenges in enhancing their news content offering? Firstly, challenges can be domain-specific, as news sites have a high publishing frequency and lots of articles have a low shelf life:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide05.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide06.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>There are exceptions to this shelf life rule, Dhaval pointed out, as articles such as Paul Ford's <em>What is Code?</em> (2015) and Tom Randall 2016 piece on climate change are still popular today.</p> <p>Dhaval made the point that there is also a danger in (over) personalization towards user consumption patterns, and the key thing is to understand how they change over time. Personalization approaches like this can have the limitation of isolating people from diverse content, and you should take care to avoid monotony in recommendations if you want a better user experience.</p> <p>Dhaval also mentioned another type of challenge inherent to recommender systems. As well as avoiding the danger of filter-bubbles, Bloomberg Media needs a scalable solution that can handle the size of the user base, and that's able to tackle the cold start problem for both items and users too.</p> <p>Providing timely recommendations is essential, as they lead to a better experience and increase trust, but there are issues with the available approaches:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide08.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>So how does Bloomberg Media overcome these problems and generate timely recommendations? Dhaval explained how they adapted the user and item based collaborative filtering (CF) approaches to build models quickly. They carefully select a subset of users and/or items for computing similarity in CF. This allows Bloomberg Media to tune to current user reading habits by training several times a day, adapting to current market trends and recommending newer content. In this way, Bloomberg Media is able to adapt to changing user behaviour while mitigating the low article shelf-life problem.</p> <p>Recommendations are computed in real-time and also reshuffled using a technique called dithering when displayed, as randomness intrigues users. The results in recent A/B tests show positive outcomes for their adjusted CF plus dithering with content similarity too:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide09.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-25-RecSysNYC-Bloomberg.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Grab Dhaval's slides to read up on his team's work at Bloomberg Media</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>Data Science for Dinner: Building a Personalization System</h2> <blockquote> <p><i>\"We use recommendations to make our service super impactful for people - not something that just increases our revenue but really changes our customers' lives.\"</i> – Marc Jansen</p> </blockquote> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p>Our third and final presenter was Marc Jansen, Data Scientist at recipe kit box company Gousto. Their model is simple but effective - they deliver a box to your doorstep with fresh ingredients and recipe cards to help you out. Marc is based in London, UK, and kicked off his presentation by describing their service and the market they're serving. Marc began with the observation that the UK market is very different from New York City. In the UK, people eat at home.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide10.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>You only need to grab a small share of that market to be a successful company, but in order to pull it off, you need a lot of manpower. One of the crucial teams is Data Science, which works fairly separately from the other parts of the company, under the direct responsibility of the CTO.</p> <p>Gousto's data science team work on mid- to long-term projects. In Marc's team, they focus on using algorithms to improve warehouse processes and everything that has to do with the online user experience. Below you can see a slide Marc 'borrowed' from his CTO on how the data streams end up at his team. (A special shout out to London company Snowplow Analytics, who capture all the data coming in from Gousto's applications and configure it into the right format):</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide11.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>As the number of available recipes grew, the users began reaching out for help finding ones they liked. Providing recommendations was a great step up from having to scroll through a list of 1500+ possibilities! There's actually a lot to recommending recipes (and food), Marc explained. The recommendation engine needs to take into account historic orders data (demand), stock handling, warehouse optimization and the personalized choice of the customer.</p> <p>When they started to work on a their first recommender system last June, they decided, as many other e-commerce businesses with lots of active customers do, to pick one based on CF (using an implementation of LightFM). This was launched in December '17. And led to some issues:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide12.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>The first challenge was that Guosto doesn't sell a static set of products. The company decides weekly what the menus are and then Marc's team needs to optimize and recommend within that set. The second challenge is a physical constraint - there's a limit on what can fit into a box. My 'favorite' limitation of the actual box is that you currently can't have more than two broccoli based menus because it simply won't fit.</p> <p>So Marc and his team decided to have a different stab at the problem. What is the core of their knowledge? Recipes! So recently they started to build a full recipe ontology (with lots of help of their chefs and support of graph database supplier Neo4j). This is the foundation of their new product: a content based recommender engine calculating recipe similarity, if you like.</p> <p>Marc shared the results he was allowed to share while we wait for the live results of the new content based recommender to come in. The off-line testing of the new recommender shows promising results (0.7 vs 0.55). Marc explained that, based on the live results of the CF product, you can conclude that people don't disagree with their recommendations, but they're not as persuasive as they could be:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-RecSysNYC-01-slide13.png\" alt=\"RecSys NYC meetup slide\"></figure> <p>Marc made an important side point while discussing this: it's really important to think about the design of your recommendations! His advice is to stay close to your UX/UI team.</p> <p>Marc finished his presentation discussing the future of the recommendations at Guosto. Their websites and apps are just the beginning, he said. The obvious next step is to incorporate recs into emails to customers. Marc expects to be doing recommendations via&nbsp;<em>voice</em> too, as Guosto have launched their Alexa app reading out recipes and making it possible to order as well.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-25-RecSysNYC-Gousto.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Download Marc's slides to prep for your own data science dinner and more on the Guosto recommendation ecosystem</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <p>I'm grateful we were able to host our inaugural NYC event at such an impressive venue, and it was fun chatting to everyone over drinks and pizza.

If you work with people who are different from you, you find new perspectives and it challenges you to be sharper. Diverse team members can keep each other's biases in check and further individual thinking. As businesses try to reach a new generation of customers with evolving sensibilities on ethnicity, age, gender, and sexuality, a diverse team will help understand your audiences better and makes a '<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dove blunder</a>' far less likely.</p> <p>Winter shared research in their talk that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shows</a> that diversity helps make teams smarter. A 2015 McKinsey report <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/organization/our%20insights/why%20diversity%20matters/diversity%20matters.ashx\">revealed</a> that companies in the top quartile for ethnic and racial diversity in management are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their industry mean. Winter sums it up in their talk as follows:</p> <p><em>\"There are endless benefits to having diverse representation in your company. It means more innovation, accuracy, market growth and higher revenue.\"</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPNYC-01-workplace-diversity.png\" alt=\"Striving to increase workplace diversity is not an empty slogan\"> <figcaption>Slide from Winter's presentation referring to this 2016 <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business Review article</a>.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Zahra, Editorial Lead at Contrast VR, agreed. Later that evening on the panel, she told us that when she started Contrast VR a year ago, hiring a diverse team was a top priority:</p> <p><em>\"The brand we created for Contrast VR was one of authentic storytelling. We cover developing countries and communities of color through the lens of people who are living in these communities. I've put together a team of people from all around the world, extremely diverse people who come from the communities we want to cover.\"</em></p> <p>But how do you make sure diversity and inclusion doesn't turn into an empty slogan? Winter suggested the following actions as takeaways:</p> <ul> <li>Do not expect people to come to you. Do the necessary outreach work.</li> <li>Create a clear value proposition for having a diverse and inclusive culture.</li> <li>Be ready with the right training and HR team in place to handle issues, and take immediate and clear action when issues do arise.</li> </ul> <p>Maarten's presentation also touched upon the importance of diversity and inclusion, particularly in corporate board rooms.</p> <h2>#2 The Future Of Publishing Is About Collaboration</h2> <p>\"What is the future of publishing?\", Maarten asked the audience, \"it's why we're all here, isn't it? It's not new technologies, it's not print or digital, it's not about your target audience - it's about collaboration.\"</p> <p>Many brands and publishers are destined to fail if they try to do it all on their own. Think long and hard about how you want to reach your target audience, but then focus on who you want work with to reach your goals - and theirs too.</p> <p>In his talk, Maarten gave a special mention to the great work of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.womensforumny.org/default/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Women's Forum of New York</a>. They strive, amongst other things, to achieve equal representation for female leaders on all corporate boards. In order to influence NYC companies they needed to be able to \"step into\" more of their offices. Maarten helped the forum by coming up with a proposition to collaborate with the chairmen and women on boards of Fortune 500 companies in NYC.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPNYC-01-jim-smith.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Smith\"></figure> <p>This resulted in more than a dozen punchy <a href=\"https://www.womensforumny.org/index.cfm/corporate-board-initiative/meet-our-ceo-champion-advocates/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video statements</a> (including from chairs at Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg) on the companies' missions for gender equality. These Women's Forum branded videos were then shared across New York City - and much further - utilizing YouTube, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJMVk86PG4I\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">coffee table book</a> displaying videos through AR technology, and the network of the board members too.</p> <h2>#3 'Print &amp; Digital' Is Not Dead</h2> <p>“Print is dead” can be heard everywhere in medialand, with a few of the latest casualties being NME <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/07/nme-ceases-print-edition-weekly-music-magazine\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">closing</a> its print edition, news publisher La Presse going <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-la-presse-print-editions-cease-layoffs-2018-1.4141359\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">online only</a>, and Mediacorp <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/04/12/mediacorp-ends-print-edition-popular-magazines-and-gives-up-publishing-elle\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ceasing</a> the print editions of <em>8 Days</em>, <em>i-Weekly</em> and local versions of <em>Elle</em>. But some people aren't buying the narrative. During a presentation late last year, Linda Thomas Brooks, president and CEO of the Association of Magazine Media (MPA), argued that <a href=\"http://www.pubexec.com/article/marketers-cant-count-print-2018/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">print is one of the most effective ways to deeply engage consumers</a>, build brand awareness, and sell products.</p> <p>Winter, who publishes Posture as a print magazine once a year, explored the liveliness of print in their presentation. They believe that niche print publications work and will continue to do so:</p> <p><em>\"I don't think that print is dead. If you're a magazine serving a particular community who doesn't feel represented or recognized in the mainstream media, then you can make it work. A good example of this is Offscreen, a print magazine with a human-centred take on technology. I think it's a beautiful, tangible way to talk about the digital age.\"</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPNYC-01-indie-media.png\" alt=\"The rise of independent (print) media\"> <figcaption>Slide from Winter's presentation celebrating successful print magazines (in combination with an e-newsletter and/or digital platform).</figcaption> </figure> <h2>#4 Only Embrace New Technologies If They Help Tell Your Story Better</h2> <p>The evening's panel kicked off with a discussion of the situations when a media company should embrace new technologies, such as 360 video, AR, and VR. Veda, who's a 360/VR producer and journalist at The New York Times, had this to say:</p> <p><em>\"Only use new technologies when there's a good journalistic case for it. I spend a lot of my time working with all the different news desks, finding out more about the stories they're working on and determining where we can add something - a kind of intimacy to the experience.\"</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPNYC-01-panel2.jpg\" alt=\"Panel\"></figure> <p>Marty, a staff writer at Adweek, agreed that you shouldn't embrace new technologies - or formats for that matter - just because you can. This will come off as gimmicky. Here's his take, inspired by his own Instagram feed:</p> <p>\"<em>Lots of people, especially in the 'influencer space' are getting this wrong. I'm not impressed by someone drinking a coffee in the Flatiron District thanking American Express for a thing.\"</em></p> <p>There are many good examples of engaging stories, he continues, created by brands by themselves or in collaboration with publishers:</p> <p><em>\"One example is the <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/pages/blockchain/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">explainer on blockchain</a> created by Goldman Sachs. Another is the <a href=\"https://www.thecloroxcompany.com/blog/improving-access-to-safe-drinking-water-in-peru/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">360 videos</a> put out by Clorox drawing attention to the global public health issue of unsafe water, and to encourage people to support it with donations. They've created the content in partnership with HuffPost, AOL and thirdly <a href=\"https://searchingforsyria.org/en/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Searching for Syria</a>, a website by Google and the UN helping people better understand the Syrian refugee crisis. They do this through the combination of data from the UN along with satellite imagery, 360 degree photos and stills, videos and stories from refugees. When I saw this, I was blown away by it.\"</em></p> <p>Marty commented on the amazing work Contrast VR has been doing too, and Zahra shared a story about their most impactful work last year:</p> <p><em> \"In 2017, we <a href=\"http://contrastvr.com/rohingya/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">covered</a> the Rohingya crisis really extensively in VR and we had something that people really wanted to watch and distribute, because the world had a lack of information about the crisis.\"</em></p> <p>Ben, SVP at VICE+, added that you shouldn't succumb to peer pressure around new technologies:</p> <p><em>\"Publishers and brands sometimes feel compelled to do stuff because 'the universe' says so. There are trends within the industry that say you should do particular subject matter, regions and types of content. You should only do the stuff that really matters to you and your audience you're trying to reach and convert.\"</em></p> <h2>#5 Innovation Is Possible Without Big Funds In-house</h2> <p>The panel moderator, our own co-founder and CEO Mads Holmen, asked the panelists how they make new technologies work from a commercial point of view. How do you manage the cost of creating new, high quality products and formats? Ben kicked off by explaining how this worked when VICE started pioneering videos at scale:</p> <p><em>\"At VICE Media, we've always seen a video as an economic multiplier. When you've shoot a video, you have stills you can capture, stories you can write, brands you can represent, and a multitude of formats, existing and yet to be imagined, you can transfer that content to.\"</em></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPNYC-01-panel.jpg\" alt=\"Panel\"></figure> <p>The focus on a different format to text also started out with bootstrapping, Ben continued:</p> <p><em>\"We only had money to do 'this one thing'. So you need to ask yourself how we can create the most value possible out of everything we do. It really has to be worth it.\" </em></p> <p>Zahra staid that the same is true for their work at Contrast VR too:</p> <p><em>\"One of the toughest things we have to do at the studio is justifying why we are doing a certain story in VR, AR or using whatever technology and spending that amount of money. We could devote that money to 5 other stories we could do. If you're able to answer that question, if we convince ourselves that this format will have a great impact, only then do we move ahead. Most of the pitches we receive, we don't do.\"</em></p> <p>Fast-forward to now, and she shared with us how she's been making things work by reaching out to brands and organizations:</p> <p><i>\"When we launched Contrast VR in April 2017, Al Jazeera gave us a budget. I quickly realized that with this budget there's nothing I could really do in our space. It's so expensive to create - and this budget was created having a 'text' editorial in mind, for which the budget was shrinking too.

The crazy amount of training, conversations and offering VR experiences in the office did pay off.\"</em></p> <p>Marty concluded that for new technologies like VR to become truly viable, they need to scale on the consumer side.

In his talk he focused on a project he did at News UK in 2016 and 2017, improving the recommendations in newsletters for <em>The Times</em> and <em>The Sun</em>.</p> <p>News UK were convinced that personalization could improve the daily email that went out to subscribers - the challenge was to do this well at scale. At the news organization they also needed to be able to quickly generate recommendations for news items as they were published.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide0.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>Daoud found that the existing algorithms and systems weren't suitable and decided to create a new algorithm for updating collaborative filtering models incrementally.</p> <p>He and his collaborators, Dion Bailey &amp; Tom Pajak (News UK) and Carlos Rodriguez (Kainano Ltd.), worked out which algorithms and architecture were needed <span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">for real-time recommendations at News UK.</span> They even wrote a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05278\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> on the productionalized system which they presented at the Thirty-seventh SGAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence last year.</p> <p>There was too much to cover in depth during a 20 minute talk, but Daoud did left us with some takeaways. While designing the algorithms and building the architecture that allowed recommendations to be generated on the fly at scale, t<span>hey discovered<span>&nbsp;</span></span>that:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide1.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>\"Chatbots?\", you might be thinking. It's a novel, future-oriented application Daoud envisages for the algorithms and architecture they designed. He's very excited about the progress he's making in that area and is keen to report on that in the near-future:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide7.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://daoudclarke.github.io/nu-recommendation-pres/\" target=\"_blank\">Daoud's test results visualized with interesting references to related work</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>Journey to Personalization</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-mahbub-gani.jpg\" alt=\"Mahbub Gani\"> <figcaption>Dr Mahbub Gani, Lead Data Scientist at Bibblio</figcaption> </figure> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"Much current ML research suffers from a growing detachment from real problems: subjective evaluation by humans is of the utmost importance.\" -&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Mahbub Gani</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">...</p> <p>Next up was Mahbub, my colleague and Lead Data Scientist at Bibblio. In his talk he gave an overview of our company's journey towards productionalizing a collaborative filtering algorithm.</p> <p>This journey was characterized by dealing with data limitations around both user and session identifiers. This is a common challenge at a 'software-as-a-service' company, where the business has no direct connection to the audience of the recommendations. Mahbub suggested some ways to resolve this issue:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide2.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>Whilst acknowledging their limitations, he went on to introduce the 'three kings' of collaborative filtering, which were all evaluated when deciding which algorithm would become the driver behind Bibblio's first personalization module:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide3.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>The evaluation of these approaches was performed in a systematic matter, kicked off by selecting a sample of 10 personas with a history of at least <em>C</em> clicks. For each persona, Mahbub then generated <em>N &lt;= C</em> recommendations for all three CF prototypes. He included two control recommenders: one which showed the top five most popular items across the catalog (Global Popularity) and one which was a list of five items chosen at random (Random).</p> <p>The subjective tests took place by having each evaluator performing a blind evaluation for each recommendation set against accuracy and diversity criteria. Mahbub also had the evaluators assign an overall “business” score to each recommender. He then ranked the recommenders according to these three scores (you shouldn't forget to check inter-annotator divergence too). And the big winners were...</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide4.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>...the Factorization Machine (labeled B in above diagram) and Alternative Least Squares (labeled C). Notice how Global Popularity ranks worst by far on accuracy, and Random, not surprisingly, scored best on diversity. Algorithm B and C had a very similar mean overall score, but differ in implementation complexity and performance quite a lot.</p> <p>Mahbub mentioned that the results had only come in on the day of the presentation, and the decision on which algorithm to productionalize would follow soon. Which algorithm would you go for - B or C? And why?</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Which algorithm? <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-17-RecSysLDN-Bibblio.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Have a look at Mahbub's presentation here and decide for yourself</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>Model Evaluation and Testing in Ranking Experiments</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-khurom-kiyani.jpg\" alt=\"Khurom H.

Kiyani, Senior Data Scientist at Deliveroo</figcaption> </figure> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\"One of the biggest cons of offline evaluation is strong positional bias, which makes it crucial you asses the quality of different rankings by using online experiments such as interleaving.\" -&nbsp;Khurom H. Kiyani</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">...</p> <p>Last but not least was Khurom, senior data scientist at our host of evening Deliveroo. The online food ordering company's goal is to connect users with the right restaurant at the right time and have them buy a meal. Choices are abundant, so a recommender system comes in handy.</p> <p>When developing a new algorithm focused on optimizing goals such as conversion rate and minimizing bounce rate, Khurom suggested the following life-cycle:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide5.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>Khurom focused on the segments highlighted blue: the offline- and online evaluations. He <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-17-RecSysLDN-Deliveroo.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">listed</a> the pros and cons of both, emphasizing the fact that the offline evaluations are often \"littered with biases that are hard to control\".</p> <p>Randomized controlled trials or A/B tests online are the <em>de facto</em> gold standard for hypothesis testing, Khurom explained, but it does need careful design otherwise it could end up being too noisy, take too long and even result in misleading results.</p> <p>One of the ways you could run a well designed online test - while combating biases such as positional prejudice - is called interleaving. Khurom had a lot of admiration for Chapelle's 2012 <a href=\"http://olivier.chapelle.cc/pub/interleaving.pdf\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> and Netflix's 2017 <a href=\"https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/interleaving-in-online-experiments-at-netflix-a04ee392ec55\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> by the Netflix team explaining this 'improved' A/B test clearly:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide6.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>By using interleaved experiments you can rapidly sift through many similar ranking algorithms, in something also known as repeated measures design:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-slide8.png\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN\"></figure> <p>Khurom believes offline testing still holds value, but to increase the fidelity of this evaluation type we should be careful to control for biases within historical rankings. Context is very important in ranking - ignore it at your peril.</p> <p>He left us with a thought-provoking question: \"If our offline ranking metrics showed that we are smashing the benchmark and our online experiments corroborated this, should we still roll-out? For example pushing more popular restaurants higher up the page.\" For the vast majority of attendees, and Khurom, the answer was \"no\".</p> <p>Algorithmic development never takes place in isolation. To go back to Mahbub's earlier point, algorithms can help to tackle real world problems if created and used properly... but can also make things worse. E<span>ither way,<span>&nbsp;i</span></span>n the case of Deliveroo they will have a real impact on the livelihoods of restaurant owners. Khurom was keen that less popular restaurants shouldn't be locked out of success by Deliveroo's algorithmic decisions.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Find out more <a href=\"https://resources.bibblio.org/hubfs/share/2018-04-17-RecSysLDN-Deliveroo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download Khurom's slides for his take on model evaluation and testing</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn04-interval.jpg\" alt=\"4th RecSysLDN event\"></figure> <p>Overall it was a great event at an impressive venue, and it was fun chatting to everyone over drinks, pizza and donuts.

    "post_date": "28-Mar-2018 11:08:07",
    "post_content": "<p>Social media was a fun fling for publishers, but search is always there for you</p> <!--more--> <p>Twitter accounts for less then 2.5% of traffic to publishers; Instagram and Pinterest barely supply 1% together. Currently, Facebook represents 22%, but its role in distributing publishers' content has been falling dramatically for more than a year, and is only accelerating.</p> <p>Data from <a href=\"https://www.parse.ly/resources/data-studies/referrer-dashboard/\" target=\"_blank\">Parse.ly</a>, which tracks visits to more than 2,500 publishers, shows that ahead of the 2016 US presidential election, more than 40 percent of traffic to those sites came from Facebook. By the end of 2017, it was less than 26 percent. It’s still dropping. For some sites, like Buzzfeed, this is a big problem, but even if you don’t rely on social traffic to the same extent, it’s a challenge.</p> <p>The chart below shows the amount of traffic coming to publishers from Google and Facebook since the beginning of 2017. It's not just Facebook's decline - the huge growth in Google mobile visitors is very striking. This can largely be&nbsp;<span>attributed to the growing popularity of AMP</span>.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-seo-google-mobsearch.png\" alt=\"Google's mobile search is sending more traffic to publishers\"> <figcaption>Source: Chartbeat</figcaption> </figure> <h3>Social traffic was never a great way to make money anyway</h3> <p>How much was social referral traffic really worth? As Scott Galloway points out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rLa0kRY4C4\" target=\"_blank\">in this great video</a>, Audience vs. Traffic: “People don’t tune in to Buzzfeed because they’re fascinated by the journalism, they click because someone forwarded them ‘Pick some of your favourite potato dishes and we’ll tell you your best quality’”. Social referrals are fickle, hard to monetize, and disappear when Facebook changes the algorithms. They’re traffic, not an audience. Even before Facebook’s changes, Buzzfeed had apparently been seeing a <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/11/30/16709310/buzzfeed-losing-web-traffic-readers-layoffs-uniques-prefer-news-over-viral-sites\" target=\"_blank\">decline in unique US visitors for two years</a>.</p> <p>In many ways the decline in social referrals is just the icing on a pretty unappetizing cake for traffic-dependant sites, which struggle to monetize beyond programmatic ads. Yields are declining, the use of ad-blockers is on the rise and Facebook and Google are hogging all the growth. Meanwhile,&nbsp; those sites that managed to build a loyal audience, like the New York Times and many special interest magazine sites, are flourishing - usually by using that loyalty to monetize in other areas like subscriptions or e-commerce.</p> <p>Social traffic was never all that great for anything other than reporting big numbers. Whilst that doesn't change the fact that&nbsp;<span>content distributed directly on platforms can be an important acquisition channel (e.g. The Economist has used Facebook as an <a href=\"https://digiday.com/uk/economist-turns-social-readers-subscribers/\" target=\"_blank\">effective way to retarget potential subscribers</a>), that only really works if you can e.g. convert your off-site viewers into paying subscribers. Monetizing content on somebody else's platform is really tough. Your company's account on Instagram may have a lot of followers, but how much value is that generating, and is it going to you or the platform? A</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax;\">s a friend likes to say: \"everyone knows National Geographic has amazing photography, but how many people remember the names of individual photographers?\"</span></p> <p>Long-term, the move away from desperately trying to drive and monetize social referral traffic is a necessary step, but right now it's still hurting many people.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax;\">So, how can you thrive despite Facebook’s continuing retreat from publishing?</span></p> <h3>The antidote to declining social traffic</h3> <p>One answer is Google. As the Chartbeat graphic shows, Google is quickly regaining its status as the primary source of referrals for publishers. So the main question becomes, how do you drive more large scale, organic traffic to your website via the search engine result pages (SERPs)?</p> <p>Basically, you need to refocus your efforts away from social traffic and re-energize your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) team. As a quick refresher, SEO is the umbrella term for many tactics, all of which aims to optimize your content for search engine algorithms, so that you rank higher when a potential visitor asks a query. The higher you rank, the better your natural traffic becomes, and the more chances you get to convert that traffic into a loyal, revenue generating audience. However, SEO in 2018 is not the SEO you remember: Google is always tinkering with algorithms and features (like AMP), and that means the best SEO tactics constantly change. Sometimes quite radically.</p> <p>What are the ranking factors that influence your SEO score most these days? Google famously doesn’t give us full transparency on ranking factors, but recently <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/ranking-factors/?infographic\" target=\"_blank\">large studies</a> by intelligence platforms such as SEMrush have shed some light into the ranking darkness. The answers probably aren’t what you expect.</p> <h3>The days of keyword stuffing are over</h3> <p>No, it’s not keywords&nbsp;(in the anchor, body, title or anywhere else) or backlinks. It’s your engagement metrics. The top 4 ranking factors are direct website visits, time on site, pages per session and bounce rate. This isn’t surprizing really when you think about it: Google wants to find the ‘best’ answers for queries, so happy Google users are a key indicator for them. What they’ve worked out is that engagement indicators, like low bounce rate, high pages per session and superior dwell time, are the best signs of a good search answer. They're also hard to game, which can't be said for keywords and backlinks.</p> <p>This all means that there is now another very obvious reason to try to increase your engagement metrics: h<span>igh engagement is a virtuous cycle. M</span>ore engagement directly means more new organic traffic, which in turn means a greater opportunity to monetize your site and build a loyal audience, which means higher engagement and more organic traffic.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-seo-ranking-factors.jpg\" alt=\"Ranking factors analyzed\"> <figcaption>Source: SEMrush</figcaption> </figure> <p>SEMrush’s study results are backed by industry experts such as Larry Kim, Founder of WordStream and CEO of <a href=\"https://mobilemonkey.com/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Monkey</a>. He says that “having positive website engagement metrics is critical” and he presents the data that shows the relationship between engagement rates (such as bounce rate and time on site) and rankings <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/do-website-engagement-rates-impact-organic-rankings\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <p>So, yes, you shouldn’t ignore keywords and backlinks, but the biggest opportunity to increase organic traffic from Google comes directly from boosting on-site engagement metrics. This is especially true for established sites that already rank fairly well.</p> <p>That leaves one question: how do you improve your SEO? If you’re already creating great content, what can you do that will impact these metrics right now?</p> <h3>How to effectively raise your site engagement and search traffic</h3> <p>SEO expert Matthew Woodward <a href=\"https://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/tutorials/internal-link-building/\" target=\"_blank\">describes</a> internal link building and content recirculation as “the most powerful SEO tactic you are not using.” Why? It increases engagement.</p> <p>Internal content recommendations are the best way to help readers discover relevant content that they really want to read. This means fewer people leaving after reading just one article, more articles per session and more time on your site. Most importantly, the more of your content they explore, the more likely they’ll be to come back. Search visitors can be fickle if they've come looking for a particular piece of content, and often leave as soon as they’ve consumed it. You give yourself the best chance of converting them into a loyal audience member by providing other high-quality content that’s relevant to their interests.</p> <p>Content recommendation is even more important when you consider that, for over half of publishers, less than 10 percent of visitors enter the site via the homepage, according to<a href=\"http://learn.parsely.com/rs/314-EBB-255/images/authority-report-11.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;research by Parse.ly</a>. This means your content pages also have to do the job of the homepage and help people find the next piece of interesting content.</p> <p>What all this adds up to is this: the related and recommended content widgets on your content pages are the single most important performance unit you have. Measure them and optimize them!</p> <p>With Bibblio, publishers can put engaging, relevant recommendations on their page in an a few minutes. Our clients have reported <strong>an increase of up to 15% in unique visitors to their site</strong> after implementing recommendation modules powered by Bibblio’s technology.</p> <p>This is because Bibblio directly affects the factors you need to rank highly on Google. Across our clients, we see an average click-through rate of 3.07%, an average increase in pages per session of 10.5% and a decrease in bounce rate of 8.7%</p> <p>Social media can still work great as an acquisition channel for publishers and media companies, but&nbsp;<span>as a dependent traffic and revenue driver<span>&nbsp;it's a</span></span>&nbsp;busted flush. You can’t rely on it to drive engaged traffic to your site, the principal source of sustainable revenue. Now that Google is the most important referral source again, SEO has a renewed importance, and the days of keyword stuffing are behind us. You should be doing everything you can to improve your user experience. An easy way to do this right now, as well as <span>implementing tools like<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/amp-digital-marketing-2018\" target=\"_blank\">AMP</a>,&nbsp;is great recommendations.</p>",

In his talk on diversifying revenue, Nick shared his insight on the importance of ranking high on the search giant’s pages:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPLDN-02-nick-flood.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Flood\"> <figcaption>Nick Flood, Deputy MD, Digital, at Dennis</figcaption> </figure> <p>“Good SEO is critical for us; 90% of traffic to Dennis’s portfolio is organic. To be number one on SERPs for finance deals or reviews drives tens of thousands of users. We haven’t focused on social: for example we didn’t believe in engaging potential car buyers on Facebook. This means that Dennis has been really protected from all the Facebook changes recently.”</p> <p>Nick has seen a massive uptick in organic traffic from Google lately, and it seems to be a reward for prioritising high quality content and good recommendations:</p> <p>“I think there was a slight change in the algorithm in January ‘18. Our editorial team writing unique guides, reviews and news has really paid off. We also do contextual recommendations of our own product offers across Dennis sites.”</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">---</p> <h2>#2 As more visitors turn to mobile, focus on initiatives that make your site faster</h2> <p>Parse.ly network data <a href=\"https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2018/03/12/73-site-visitors-get-via-mobile-heres-guided-tour-mobile-landscape/\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\">shows</a> that on average over 65% of traffic to publisher and brand sites in 2017 was “pure mobile”. Now, at the beginning of 2018, mobile and tablets drive 73% of traffic to publishers. Over the past year,&nbsp;Mobile Google Search traffic to AMP-enabled publishers working with Chartbeat <a href=\"http://blog.chartbeat.com/2018/02/15/google-is-up-what-to-do-about-it/\" target=\"_blank\">is up 100%</a>.</p> <p>Nick emphasized that site speed is critical, especially for mobile:</p> <p>“60% of Dennis visitors are now on mobile. We’re working with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Progressive Web App (PWA). I’d recommend to get really involved in <a href=\"https://digiday.com/careers/wtf-progressive-web-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">PWA</a>. It’s going to be absolutely massive from an e-commerce perspective too.”</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;---</p> <h2>#3 Have a strategy for ad blocking and analytics blocking on your site</h2> <p>It’s hitting you harder than you might think. Pierre has been gathering worldwide data on ad blocking and analytics blocking since 2016. He shared some key findings in his talk:</p> <p>“The general trends in ad blocking and analytics blocking are too general. Every website and even every site section is unique. Ad blocking on article pages works differently than on your homepage. It also depends in which country and what time your site is visited.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPLDN-02-pierre-far.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Far\"> <figcaption>Pierre Far, Founder of Blockmetry</figcaption> </figure> <p>\"For example, In the UK we have the highest ad blocking rate at 3am. People browsing at that hour are blocking ads like mad - it can get as high as 60% at that time.</p> <p>“And don’t forget about the cheapest way to block ads: disabling JavaScript. 0.2% of page views worldwide have this programming language disabled. That doesn’t seem like much. In some countries it’s significant though. In Finland it’s 1.2%. In the East-Asian countries China, Taiwan, South-Korea and Japan the JavaScript disable rate ranges from 1.5 to 2.5%.”</p> <p>Pierre pointed out that ad blocking tools won’t only hurt your ad revenue, but can also add lots of noise to your audience insights:</p> <p>“As a publisher you need to be aware that most ad blocking software also blocks your analytics. At the moment, worldwide, 8.5% of page views&nbsp;doesn’t fire the Google Analytics tag. In some countries we’re talking even bigger numbers: 20% in Germany, 16% in France and 12% in USA. In the UK it’s 7.5% but that percentage is rising. If you want a nice bonus and get a huge bump in your traffic, then install an anti-ad blocker with an accurate measurement tool built in.”</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;---</p> <h2>#4 Own the relationship with your audience</h2> <p>With GDPR and ePrivacy regulations coming into play later this year, publishers, marketers and ad-tech companies will need to get users to consent to their data being used for personalizing the content and ad experience.</p> <p>There’s still some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/gdpr-looming-key-compliance-questions-still-remain/\" target=\"_blank\">confusion</a> over when businesses need to get consent and exactly what consent is required, and some are <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/gdpr-will-lead-scramble-pass-off-liability-others/\" target=\"_blank\">trying</a> to push liability to others in the chain. According to Pierre, publishers need to pay close attention:</p> <p>“GDPR and the ePrivacy regulation will affect how internet service providers (ISPs), ad networks and browsers behave. Do watch this space very carefully, as the incentives are not always aligned with publishers’ and users’ needs.”</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPLDN-02-talks.jpg\" alt=\"Presentations at Future of Media &amp; Publishing London, 2nd meetup\"></figure> <p>He believes that of all the actors involved, the browsers are the best candidates for being nurtured as allies for publishers and media. This is because they care about their users and the experience they offer. But the ultimate play, Pierre underlined, is always going to be a direct relationship with your users:</p> <p>“In my opinion, the only defensible relationship is between the publisher and the user. It’s crucial to own the relationship with your audience - it’s where the value exchange happens. Own the monetization of your relationship too. Don’t outsource it for pennies on the pound via someone else.”</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;---</p> <h2>#5 Diversify your content and monetization too</h2> <p>The background concern for every&nbsp;publisher&nbsp;and media business is how to become less dependent on platforms, create sustainable audience growth and safeguard against unstable ad revenues. The key to that in 2018<span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1.5vmax;\">&nbsp;is diversification, and that means content as well as revenue sources.</span></p> <p>As new technologies develop and mature, the way we consume content is changing. Businesses need to have one eye on where developments are headed. Nick shed some light on the world of audio:</p> <p>“I’m confident that the vast majority of people currently only use Alexa in their home to listen to the radio or play their favourite Spotify playlist. But this will change. In three of four years it’ll be a smart device in your home controlling your lights, heating... and reading out publishers’ stories too.”</p> <p>It's no longer just Alexa - it's Google Home and Apple's HomePod as well - and voice is an increasing part of search, and therefore SEO, too. The truth is that it's easier to say things than to type them, and that's being reflected in the <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-reveals-20-percent-queries-voice-queries-249917\" target=\"_blank\">growing number of voice searches</a> on Google. Don't ignore this trend.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPLDN-02-molly-flatt.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Flatt\"> <figcaption>Molly Flatt, Associate Editor of FutureBook, Associate Editor of The Memo and Digital Editor of PHOENIX</figcaption> </figure> <p>Another form of content, or really a delivery mechanism of content, which got a lot of airtime was the newsletter. Molly talked about the interesting evolution this format has gone through:</p> <p>“Back in the day I loved them, then they suffered because of the spam backlash email got and now they have an amazing renaissance. A good newsletter should feel like a personal space - a curated escape from the wilds of endless content.”</p> <p>With the current focus on \"<a href=\"https://www.fipp.com/news/opinion/peter-houston-talks-time-well-spent\" target=\"_blank\">time</a> <a href=\"http://humanetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">well</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/11/facebook-time-well-spent/\" target=\"_blank\">spent</a>\", as well as progress in recommendation and personalization, the well-targeted newsletter might be about to experience a moment in the sun.</p> <p>Needless to say, the other hot topic when it comes to diversification is revenue. Without a variety of sustainable revenue sources, there's a real risk that a business loses the ability to steer its future, and an external move like a Facebook algorithm tweak can lead to it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/littlethings-shuts-casualty-facebook-news-feed-change/\">shutting down</a>,&nbsp;which happened to&nbsp;publisher&nbsp;LittleThings.</p> <p>One way of diversifying your revenue streams is a subscription or membership model. Many publishers are experimenting with freemium models, hard paywalls or even metered paywalls that <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/02/after-years-of-testing-the-wall-street-journal-has-built-a-paywall-that-bends-to-the-individual-reader/\">bend</a> to the individual reader based on signals that indicates how likely they’ll be to subscribe.</p> <p>Our panelists see the value of direct revenue for the reader, but recognize it’s not for everyone. Nick believes that if you offer over-commoditized media, introducing a paywall is not going to solve your problems:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">“I don’t think there are a lot of people willing to pay for celebrity stories.”</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-FoMPLDN-02-emillie-ruston.jpg\" alt=\"Emillie Ruston\"> <figcaption>Emillie Ruston, Head of Customer Success at Pugpig</figcaption> </figure> <p>Having said that, Emillie has seen publishers she works with make a success out of asking for direct payment from users, but the price is often volume:</p> <p>“The advertising model has taken a hit. When you have a subscription or membership model in place you tend to have a smaller user base, but the users you do have return and stay a lot longer on your site.</p> <p>“People do want to pay for better content. It's important to have the payment option as part of a seamless user experience, either via an app store or easily using the browser.\"</p> <p>Is a form of paywall, metered of otherwise, the only way to get readers to pay for editorial content? Nick offered some thoughts on other options publishers could consider:</p> <p>“Doing paywalls really well is really hard. There are different strategies too. For example you could also ask people to disable their ad blocker&nbsp;to get access to your best content, work with <a href=\"https://brave.com/publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">Brave</a> or another extension that allows people to reward you.”</p> <p>Asking users to reward you in the form of user donations, like the Guardian has been doing since last summer, has made its impact on the wider publishing industry too. Molly spoke about the direct-to-user disruption she has seen in the book trade:</p> <p>“We’ve seen a huge growth in crowdfunded books through sites like <a href=\"https://unbound.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Unbound</a>, where you, as the crowd, trade your money for a degree of editorial control and a say about design and production. We’ve already seen some great stories like ‘Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls’ and ‘The Good Immigrant’ come out of that. It’s the activist way of improving diversity in the industry too.”</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;---</p> <h2>#Bonus: Five ways to navigate your way through the world of online content</h2> <p>Our speakers and panellists are consumers too.

    "post_content": "<p>Which are the most important industry forecasts for 2018?</p> <!--more--> <p>Predictions are always plentiful at the beginning of a new year, but which ones should you actually pay attention to if you want to to be able to help your business? Now that the dust has settled, we’ve reviewed the most popular predictions for digital publishing in 2018 and picked out the ones which can really help you understand where the year is headed.</p> <p>At Bibblio, our main concern is how to build a sustainable, profitable content ecosystem that works for publishers and audiences. There are signs that that is beginning to happen, and these forecasts can help you understand how it will come about so that you can adapt to the new reality.</p> <p>The forecasts are all linked by one overarching theme - the crisis of digital advertising combined with the \"Duopoly\" capturing more and more of the market and almost all of the growth. This has hammered the ad-funded digital content model, and means that everybody else in the sector has to find other ways to make money. From AI to new key metrics, find out what trends are helping them do that in 2018:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>1. Publishers will start to free themselves from the honey trap of platforms</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-4-predictions-platforms.png\" alt=\"Publishers will start to free themselves from the honey trap of platforms\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Publishers will break their dependence on platforms”</em><br> - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicnewman?lang=en\">Nic Newman</a>,&nbsp;<span>Digital Strategist at the Reuters Institute,</span> in <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-01/RISJ%20Trends%20and%20Predictions%202018%20NN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Journalism, Media, and Technology Trends and Predictions 2018</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p>The platforms promised the world to publishers in exchange for them giving up ownership of their relationship with users. In revenue terms, they haven’t delivered. That’s becoming harder to ignore, especially with referral traffic from e.g. <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/promised-facebook-traffic-news-publishers-declines-post-news-free-change/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook already dropping</a>, after it announced that it would be cutting back the amount of news in users’ feeds by 20%, and video not bringing in the revenue that was promised.</p> <p>The latest survey by <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-01/RISJ%20Trends%20and%20Predictions%202018%20NN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The Reuters Institute</a> reveals that around half (44%) of executives are more worried about the power of platforms than they were at this time last year (although it’s worth noting that sentiment is far more positive towards Google than the other players). This concern is going to manifest itself in more publishers pulling out of deals with e.g. Facebook, Apple, and Snapchat that they don’t feel are benefitting them and focusing on increasing direct readership instead.</p> <p>It's not the end of the story for publishers and platforms though. Some publishers are increasingly seeing Google and Facebook as acquisition channels rather than trying to rely on them for revenue. A good example is The Economist, which gives away some content in order to then <a href=\"https://digiday.com/uk/economist-turns-social-readers-subscribers/\" target=\"_blank\">retarget interested readers</a>.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <h2>2. It’s going to be The Year of the Subscriber, but is subscription the new ‘Pivot to Video’?</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-4-predictions-subscriptions.png\" alt=\"It’s going to be The Year of the Subscriber, but is subscription the new ‘Pivot to Video’?\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Whereas certain titles had a 10:90 ratio of subscription to ad revenue in 2012, we predict it may be 50:50 by 2020” -</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/technologymediatelecommunications/gx-deloitte-tmt-2018-digital-media-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Deloitte 2018 Digital Media Report</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the consequences of the decline of advertising revenue for publishers, and their increasingly fraught relationship with platforms, is that many are looking for new revenue sources. One of the most popular new models, is, in fact, an old one - charging for subscription.</p> <p>There have been a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/new-york-times-company-earnings.html\" target=\"_blank\">huge</a> <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/investopedia-shifted-subscription-revenue-video-courses/\" target=\"_blank\">number</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.no/20170925/why-norwegian-media-lead-the-world-in-digital-subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6191822-075e-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5\" target=\"_blank\">good</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/4/16971436/apple-music-surpass-spotify-us-subscribers\" target=\"_blank\">news</a> <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/swedish-tabloid-aftonbladet-reached-250000-digital-subscribers/\" target=\"_blank\">stories</a> for subscription services across the content spectrum over the last few years, but that doesn’t make it a panacea for publishers. The CEO of subscription revenue’s poster child, the New York Times, said in his predictions for 2018:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Most news organizations contemplate or launch pay models, most of which fail.”</em>&nbsp;- Mark Thompson, CEO New York Times, in <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-01/RISJ%20Trends%20and%20Predictions%202018%20NN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Journalism, Media, and Technology Trends and Predictions 2018</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p>So, whilst predictions that subscription will flourish this year are maybe <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/wallets-get-opened/\" target=\"_blank\">the most common</a>, along with advice on <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/address-users-as-individuals/\" target=\"_blank\">how to do it well</a>, it’s worth thinking about what makes your product unique enough to make someone open their wallet for it. Users won't pay for generic, undifferentiated content. There's also an open question as to how much content to give away to lure in readers, and and how and when to introduce the 'pain' to persuade them to convert. Do you have a metered paywall after five free articles? A premium content in a members area? We'll have more answers by the end of 2018, but it's unlikely there'll be a one-size-fits-all solution.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <h2>3. Loyalty is the word on everybody’s lips</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-4-predictions-loyalty.png\" alt=\"Loyalty is the word on everybody’s lips\"></figure> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Which metrics are better indicators of what’s working to cultivate and retain folks?

Loyal users read more content, engage with it more deeply and are more likely to share content and act as evangelists for a publisher.</p> <p>Learning what leads to loyalty, and then measuring and optimising for it, are going to be key to businesses moving beyond a purely ad-based model. That move is well underway. As reported in <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/era-loyalty-newspaper-publishers-rethink-focus-pageviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Digiday</a>, Hearst Newspapers has begun focussing on users who visit at least 10 times per month, rather than uniques, and The Boston Globe prioritizes creating the sorts of stories that convert subscribers over those that simply increase traffic. The need to discover and optimise for ‘loyalty metrics’ is something Bibblio <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/a-new-goal-for-digital-publishers-in-2018-your-loyalty-metric-eb5b1a21dc3e\" target=\"_blank\">discussed earlier in the year</a> too.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Driving loyalty requires focusing on quality.

Smart algorithms and the data feedback loop mean you can make better and better decisions when the next users come.</p> <p><span>It’s not a coincidence that these advances are being embraced as the drive towards alternative revenue streams gathers pace.</span>&nbsp;Publishers are beginning to understand how AI is a key tool to improve users’ experiences. It also frees up editorial staff to do work where ‘human’ skills really add value.</p> <p>One example of how AI is helping is by allowing organisations to understand users better, and produce and recommend the distinctive content that creates loyalty and justifies a subscription. Experiments with AI software writing content have also shown that very low margin coverage <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/washington-posts-robot-reporter-published-500-articles-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\">doesn’t require employing an expensive human to do it</a>. In an industry where understanding the audience has never been more essential and margins have never been more squeezed, this technology is going to deliver serious results.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“AI/intelligent assistants solving for consumer needs across devices, environments, media is the big tech story of the year.” -&nbsp;</em>Mark Thompson, CEO New York Times, in <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2018-01/RISJ%20Trends%20and%20Predictions%202018%20NN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Journalism, Media, and Technology Trends and Predictions 2018</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course ‘personalization’ via AI has been the great hope of some areas of publishing for a while, but it’s not clear what direction it will take. After personalization was implicated in all the problems created by hyper-partisan Facebook filter bubblers, it became clear that it’s a two-edged sword. This is especially true when most organisations lack the sort of user data needed to make personalization act as anything other than a crude interest filter. However, there’s some hope that personalization can be a lot more than that:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“...this is the year where there should be a wider focus on using personalization to inform, educate, and foster common understanding.”</em>&nbsp;- <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TamarCharney?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tamar Charney</a>, Managing Editor NPR One, in <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/we-get-serious-about-algorithms/\" target=\"_blank\">NiemanLab’s Predictions for Journalism 2018</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p>That’s a goal for AI editorial tools that we should all get behind. We’ve seen the endgame of the race to the bottom of the attention barrel in the crappiest recesses of the internet, and that’s not a place the publishing industry can afford to go.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>–––</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p>Where does that leave us for 2018? To sum up, we're going to see increasing numbers of digital content businesses looking to alternative ways to monetize as they retreat from ad-funded platform strategies, and to do that successfully they will need to work very hard to cultivate a loyal audience. AI will play a growing role in helping to achieve that, as well as becoming a key editorial tool to help publishers do more, smarter, with less.</p>",

They organise bi-annual hackathon events for all employees.</p> <p>During the last three-day hackathon, a colleague of Yaqub's had the idea to try to build a recommender system using game screenshots, like these:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ps-shots.jpg\" alt=\"Playstation game screenshots\"> <figcaption>Playstation game screenshots</figcaption> </figure> <p>The motivation for this was that because this content is available early in the game development, it could help out with recommending pre-orders to people.</p> <p>During the three-day hackathon Yaqub and a group of co-workers implemented a system using autoencoders to represent screenshots downloaded from the Playstation store as numeric vectors.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ps-autoencoders.jpg\" alt=\"Images: Convolutional autoencoders\"> <figcaption>\"If you put this cat in, you want the same cat out.\"</figcaption> </figure> <p>They were then able to group screenshots belonging to the same game, based on image similartiy, to improve scoring. An impressive feat.&nbsp;</p> <p>The result was that they had a system which when fed in a screenshot from a known game, could correctly recognise that game in a lot of cases. <span>On top of this, if they provided the system with the</span>&nbsp;name of an existing game from the store then it could retrieve a list of similar games. They could also take a user-provided screenshot, perhaps representative of a game the user enjoyed, and provide a list of similar games:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ps-p2p.jpg\" alt=\"Examples of product to product recommendations\"></figure> <p>This would enable a user to discover similar games by aesthetic and scenes, or games which were only just being demoed at The Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p> <p>The results were rather good. Yaqub concluded: “We used a very simple metric called ‘maximum inner product’ which would give you the most similar other pair of screenshots. For product-to-product recommendation the results were actually really sensible, given we only used this ‘dumb’ metric.”</p> <p>He emphasised that this was done as a hackathon project and has not been taken further as far as he knows. I personally wouldn’t mind this popping up as a discovery tool in game store interfaces soon!</p> <p class=\"diversion\"><a href=\"https://goo.gl/6c5zXA\" target=\"_blank\">Have a play with Yaqub’s slides</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">–––</p> <h2>Explicit vs. Implicit Recommenders</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-maciej-kula.jpg\" alt=\"Maciej Kula\"> <figcaption>Maciej Kula, Ravelin</figcaption> </figure> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Of course you should always use different metrics when evaluating recommender systems. I just argue RMSE should never be among them.” -&nbsp;Maciej&nbsp;Kula</em></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;...</p> <p>Maciej recently joined Ravelin as machine learning engineer, after having worked as data scientist and research engineer at Lyst and Netflix&nbsp;<span>respectively</span>.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ravelin-takeaways.jpg\" alt=\"Takeaways\"></figure> <p>He didn’t beat about the bush and immediately introduced the purpose of his talk: to convince the audience that a) root mean square error (RMSE) is never an appropriate evaluation metric for a recommender system, and b) that in most cases implicit feedback is far more valuable than explicit feedback.</p> <p>After taking us through the definitions of explicit - and implicit feedback recommender systems and RMSE, Maciej pointed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize\">The Netflix Challenge</a> and its results as the reason why explicit recommenders and RMSE are still treated as a standard solution today:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ravelin-netflix.jpg\" alt=\"The Netflix Challenge\"></figure> <p>But implicit feedback, he argued, is more useful than that. Or rather, there is a problem with recommender systems build solely on explicit feedback. The assumption behind models trained and evaluated only on observed ratings is that ratings that are not observed are missing at random. And that’s false:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-ravelin-ratings.jpg\" alt=\"Are ratings missing at random?\"></figure> <p>Referring to the experiment <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Training-and-testing-of-recommender-systems-on-dat-Steck/940b01d0d7931cb9d4d24f5bd50625b941b31a13\">Steck ran in 2010</a> on the MovieLens dataset, Maciej concluded that implicit feedback alone is much better than explicit feedback alone, although putting the two together gives the best results. He raised the interesting point that Netflix<a href=\"https://qz.com/1188058/netflix-explains-why-badly-reviewed-bright-killed-with-viewers/\">&nbsp;doesn't use ‘stars’ any more</a>, as part of the company’s efforts to move away from explicit feedback.</p> <p>After his talk I opened the floor to questions. In the history of RecSys London - I appreciate we’ve only had 3 Meetups so far - it’s hard to remember having more of a debate than the one we had after this talk. So what do you think: Do you think that RMSE has value?

    "post_content": "<p>Even if you don't have data about your users, you can still build an effective recommender system to keep them engaged by showing them more great content</p> <!--more--> <p><strong>TL;DR:&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">Your first approach could be to build a content-based recommender which recommends other similar content items without requiring any user data. The features (i.e. the mathematical representations of the different aspects of the content items the recommender algorithm needs to perform its computations) would be constructed from information about the content items themselves, rather than user behavior. With written content you might use semantic technology to derive your features from the text.</span></p> <p>With this system as a benchmark, you could try to enhance your recommendations by introducing additional features such as metadata extracted from the text. You could also&nbsp;<span>take it a step closer to a personalized recommender, even without explicit user identifiers,&nbsp;<span>by using a proxy for the user ID to</span></span> provide a form of personalization. Finally, supposing your users look at several content items during each visit, you could build a localized, session-based recommender, which is one that bases recommendations on immediate trends within a user’s session.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">–––</p> <p><strong>“How do you build a recommender system without user data?”</strong> This is a question we’ve come across a few times, so I thought that I’d have a go at answering it. I should say up front that this piece 1) assumes a certain amount of fundamental knowledge about how recommender systems work, and 2) uses some jargon (where essential!) So, I’ll try and give context where it ends up getting technical, and if you want to know more about the basics of recommendation that aren’t covered here, why not try this excellent practical <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/recommender-systems-python\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a>.</p> <p>Broadly, there are three possible ways to build a recommender system without user data. I’ve set them out below in increasing order of sophistication, and I’ve assumed that you’re taking advantage of the data that <em>is</em> available. Each method gets closer to leveraging user data, in the form of unique identifiers and user information, even if you don’t actually have it.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">–––</p> <p><strong>Build a content-based recommender system</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">Firstly, you can build a standard content-based recommender system using, for example, any tags or other content metadata as features. You could apply a form of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">TF-IDF</a><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\"> scoring for your algorithm, where the tags represent individual words which are found in a pre-computed dictionary. (The dictionary is simply a data structure that contains the entire collection of individual words extracted from each content item.)</span></p> <p>Specifically, if you take all of the tags and all of the other features and construct a dictionary out of that, then that will enable you to build a so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model\" target=\"_blank\">‘feature vector’</a>. You then use vectors as the basis for comparing different content items before making a recommendation. Following this recipe will enable you to build a rudimentary content based recommender, which from my experience works quite well. All you’re doing is recommending content similar to your original piece, with ‘similar’ here meaning that the recommended content has similar tags and features to the original content.</p> <p>The very first thing you can do to create a more sophisticated system is iterate and use your rudimentary content recommender as a benchmark to improve upon. There are other techniques you can use as well which I’ll describe below.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">–––</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Improving your content-based recommender</strong></p> <p>The procedure described above draws upon a single dictionary consisting of your current tags and other features.The next level of sophistication is to have two or more separate dictionaries - one each for different classes of metadata. You produce TF-IDF scores for your recommendations and perform a weighted combination of these scores for each content item based on the multiple dictionaries. You can optimize the parameters (i.e. the weights of the scores) according to the results of a subjective evaluation. This is to see which parameter weighting gives the best quality recommendations.</p> <p>If you have a class of metadata which doesn’t lend itself well to a TF-IDF scoring, e.g. it's not discrete, then I recommend you segment the data&nbsp;<span>within that class&nbsp;</span>into different categories. When you segment it that gives you another set of tags (e.g. one for each segmented category). Provided that you don’t create a huge number of features, the additional complexity shouldn’t impact you too much.</p> <p>You could then enhance your recommendations further, or focus them, by introducing filters e.g. for a particular tag. This is not part of the core algorithm, but it’s a collateral scaffold in which you embed that algorithm which will enable users to specify criteria for the recommendations.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; text-align: center; background-color: transparent;\">–––</span></p> <p><strong>Build a recommender which draws upon a proxy for the user</strong></p> <p>The next level of sophistication is to look at&nbsp;<span>data characteristics<span>&nbsp;which can serve as a&nbsp;</span></span>proxy for the user. Even though you don’t have unique user IDs, you may have the IP address, browser information or other kinds of information that you’ve harvested for each user session.</p> <p>From this you can construct a notional user ID. It isn’t going to be bulletproof, but it’s a form of rudimentary fingerprinting. Once you are able to designate an ‘abstract’ user, you can start generating personalized recommendations for that user, specifically by drawing upon e.g. a variety of collaborative filtering approaches. Again I don’t think this is too complicated - there are lots of open source approaches out there. (A high-level Python package, for instance, <a href=\"http://surprise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">can be found here</a>.) The key thing here is that you now have one way of constructing the user ID based on the proxy information you have.</p> <p>The other thing you need is click interaction data. You need to know what items have been clicked, otherwise you have no way of developing a notion of preference to optimize towards. Once you have both of this data and a notional user ID, you can create a form of recommender that personalizes to the combination of an IP address and some browser information. This is not true personalization, but it’s at least on the road there.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">–––</p> <p><strong>Build a session-based recommender</strong></p> <p>The final broad approach is to build a session-based recommender. It’s similar to the previous approach, but this time you’re focusing on data from a particular session, which you'll probably have even if you don’t have user information. If you have session IDs, then you can use those as a highly localized ‘user ID’ equivalent.</p> <p>There are a variety of session-based recommenders, some of which are rather sophisticated based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) such as the work of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06939\" target=\"_blank\">Hidasi and Karatzoglou</a>. These systems have been shown to deliver very promising results.</p> <p>A session-based recommender does assume that users are prepared to go on a journey. <span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">If they are and they accumulate a sufficient number of clicks, then the system gets better at recommending a compelling next item for them to view and consider.</span></p> <p>I hope that you've found this interesting!

    "post_content": "<p>The 5 phases of product development for building responsible, people-friendly algorithms</p> <!--more--> <p>The role and impact of algorithms has been getting a lot of attention lately. They make decisions for us on a daily basis and we’re finally asking questions about the practical and ethical implications.</p> <p>This is wonderful. On the flip-side of this stands a more pragmatic question: how to go about actually building them. Many technical guides and tutorials can be found in answer but scant attention is given to the role of processes and people. This myopic, technical view is perhaps a subtle but significant contributor to the unmanaged, runaway impact that algorithms have had on our daily lives. So how does one harness a broader set of viewpoints to build more responsible algorithms? I’d like to share my experience tackling this topic as Head of Product at Bibblio.</p> <p>During the past couple of years we’ve taken Bibblio’s algorithm products through the startup gauntlet. Simple, quickly-hacked-together prototypes gave way to robust, scalable architectures and data pipelines. A whole new type of problem emerged when we started designing algorithms. Between us we hold the perspectives of educators, philosophers, data scientists, software developers, product managers, lawyers, designers, media theorists, and customer support. Each one can provide distinctly valuable input on every algorithm, especially when trying to build them responsibly. The challenge lies in harnessing these perspectives.</p> <p>So how do it? Firstly, let’s not pretend a problem like this could ever be ‘cracked’. It’s an ongoing challenge and we work on it constantly. Our current process is divided into five phases. Each phase serves as a transition from one mindset to another. This facilitates a diverse set of inputs from various members of the team. This is of course subject to having a diverse team in the first place, so that’s definitely worth considering.</p> <p>Each phase entails a series of steps and has key outcomes. Let’s go through them.</p> <h2>1) Incentive Phase</h2> <p><em>From product development to data science.</em></p> <p>You could call this the <em>ideation</em> phase but it’s a slippery slope from there to platitudes like <em>leveraging synergy</em>. I prefer 'incentive' because I think it’s worth highlighting that there is (and should be) an incentive that drives algorithm behaviour. Facebook claims to be about connecting people but is ultimately incentivised to keep users scrolling and revealing their preferences in order to serve them more targeted ads. So what is the incentive to build an algorithm in the first place? More clicks? More sales? Higher ‘satisfaction’? What does that even mean? How can it be measured? What are the social implications of optimising that metric? These are deep, difficult questions that are dangerously easy to ignore. If answered early, they can guide the entire process to a far more intentional result.</p> <p>The incentive phase is also the easiest and most obvious place to elicit broader input. Talk to customers, support staff and product managers about your goals and how they might be achieved. Discuss the social impact of apparently self-evident measures and assumptions. There’s probably someone on the team with a humanities background and a knack for the big picture. Speak to them, even if only to organise your own thoughts. Their perspective is valuable and it will rub off if you engage with it.</p> <p><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>identify product needs</li> <li>establish algorithmic incentives</li> <li>discuss measurements and optimizations relating to these incentives</li> <li>communicate objectives to data scientists&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Outcomes:</em></strong></p> <ul> <li>considered intentions</li> <li>clear R&amp;D objectives</li> </ul> <h2>2) Research &amp; Development Phase</h2> <p><em>From data science back to product development.</em></p> <p>During R&amp;D we go from an incentive to identifying a specific algorithm for implementation. This might seem obvious, but from an entrenched agile perspective it’s easy to imagine a process that moves from incentive directly to a minimum viable product or prototype. Move fast and break stuff, right? This doesn’t hold so well for algorithms. There are often several viable options and a variety of established implementations of each. The best-performing one is also likely to be highly contextual. What might work on one data set could fail miserably on another. That said, lean/agile methodologies are valuable and can be applied here. Move quickly, iterate, evaluate, adapt. These principles hold but they should be applied to the process of selecting and designing an algorithm, not building one in production (yet).</p> <p>For us this means isolated, trial implementations of several distinct algorithms, often in Python Jupyter Notebooks outside of the core stack. These implementations accumulate through spikes. Each one answers a specific question about the performance of a particular algorithm and is concluded with product and technical feedback. To focus R&amp;D and retain shared goals we place emphasis on executing and testing them as per our normal development and QA processes. A product manager helps constrain the spikes, the dev team helps estimate them (often as time-boxes), and they are acceptance-tested by members of both the product and dev teams.</p> <p>In practice, testing tends to require little more than an in-depth conversation. The data science team imparts trade-offs, parameters and performance metrics for each algorithm, as well as a technical review of the trial implementation. You could say that the purpose of each spike is not only to answer a question but also to deliver the context of an algorithm across various mindset boundaries. The devs gain technical context for implementation and the product manager gains a functional understanding of each algorithm.<span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Once all spikes have been completed we perform a blind, qualitative evaluation of the results with the broader team. A diverse set of people test sample outputs, evaluating them against the incentives and measures determined in phase one. Thereafter we present the top-ranking algorithms and make our final selection as a team.</p> <p><em>Steps:</em></p> <ul> <li>identify a series of R&amp;D spikes to investigate various algorithms</li> <li>constrain those spikes with the product team to focus intentions and prevent research sprawl</li> <li>execute spikes on the backlog where they are visible to the dev team</li> <li>QA spikes with product and dev team</li> <li>evaluate algorithm performance with broader team</li> <li>select best-performing algorithm (measured according to the initial incentive)</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Outcomes:</em></p> <ul> <li>a considered choice of algorithm to implement</li> <li>shared understanding of algorithm particulars across data science, dev and product teams</li> <li>an isolated, reference implementation of the algorithm selected for production</li> </ul> <h2>3) Product Development Phase</h2> <p><em>From product to software development.</em></p> <p>From this point on we’re in more familiar territory. We now have specific objectives that must be sliced into user stories and fed to the scrum machine. That’s oversimplifying it a bit; a lot goes into mapping product features to technical requirements. That is, however, outside the scope of this article. The important bit is that we now have a clear feature request in two parts: our initial incentive and a trial implementation of the selected algorithm. A standard agile dev process should be perfectly capable of handling it from here. The product and dev teams should have enough context to break the feature down into user stories since they’ve been so involved in the process thus far.</p> <p>There is one caveat: this is an opportunity to maintain quality in the algorithm stack. How the algorithm is fitted to existing architecture can lead to beautiful code or an incomprehensible mess. Where that lands is entirely up to the quality standards the team employs during this and the subsequent phase.</p> <p><em>Steps:</em></p> <ul> <li>deconstruct algorithm and fit to current system architecture</li> <li>create user stories</li> <li>communicate both the algorithm's design and incentive in these user stories</li> </ul> <p><em>Outcomes:</em></p> <ul> <li>modular algorithm design</li> <li>clear user stories</li> </ul> <h2>4) Implementation Phase</h2> <p><em>From software development back to product.</em></p> <p>This is another standard phase that’s outside the scope of this article so we won’t go into much detail. There should now be user stories on a backlog for the dev process to work through. Be sure to provide data science support to the devs. If you’re lucky enough to have a data scientist with an interest in software development and knowledge of the relevant programming language then there’s no reason to stop them from implementing a few choice user stories in production. Feel free to blur some boundaries in the interest of collaboration. At the very least make sure there’s good communication between data science, product and dev during this phase and be sure to encourage the dev team to maintain quality (and give them the time they need to do it).</p> <p><em>Steps:</em></p> <ul> <li>implement user stories</li> <li>iterate, evaluate, adapt</li> </ul> <p><em>Outcomes:</em></p> <ul> <li>production-grade algorithm code</li> <li>shared understanding of the algorithm stack</li> </ul> <h2>5) Testing Phase</h2> <p><em>From product development to customers.</em></p> <p>Once the new algorithm has been implemented we need to test it against our initial incentives. I’m not talking about unit testing or QA on each story. That’s important too so don’t skip those bits. Once that’s done we need to zoom all the way back out and test our implementation to see if it actually does what we want it to. This means another round of subjective evaluation. Probably another round of user stories to adjust some tuning parameters and fix bugs too. Then it’s time to get customers involved. Beta test with a small set of friendly customers if you can. A/B test if that’s an option. However you do it, you’re ready to roll this out and keep learning from it in the wild.</p> <p><em>Steps:</em></p> <ul> <li>perform internal qualitative evaluations</li> <li>iterate on corrective user stories</li> <li>beta or A/B test</li> <li>release your algorithm unto the world</li> </ul> <p><em>Outputs:</em></p> <ul> <li>a shiny new algorithm in production</li> </ul> <p>This process should foster collaboration and a shared understanding of the implication of each algorithm. You should have ample opportunity to evaluate them from a variety of perspectives. It’s worth thinking about the mindsets you wish to foster and include when doing so. Process merely provides a framework. This one yields opportunities to consider the impact of your decisions and assumptions.</p> <p>It is ultimately up to you to elicit diverse input, ask difficult questions, and listen when others question your goals and assumptions.</p>",

    "post_content": "<p><strong>Tailoring to users helps, but giving them agency and being unique are more crucial to your success</strong></p> <!--more--> <p>With so much content so easily available to everyone online, it’s hard to hold people’s attention. Helping your users to find your most relevant content is essential if you’re going to do that. Nowadays, many efforts to do this are lumped under the umbrella term '<em>personalization</em>’.</p> <p>To call it a hot topic is a bit of an understatement. In a <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-data-driven-race-toward-personalization/\">recent survey</a> done by DigiDay, fifty-six percent of publisher executives said personalizing of content is “a high or very high priority”.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-alan-soon.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Soon\"> <figcaption>Alan Soon, co-founder, The Splice Newsroom</figcaption> </figure> <p>Many commentators, such as Alan Soon at The Splice Newsroom, <a href=\"https://us11.campaign-archive.com/?u=44d342cbebd6a5cf1ecc09bbf&amp;id=2913e25294\" target=\"_blank\">describe personalization as the future of media</a>. Some have even started to score companies based on their personalization efforts. Last year, Sailthru, an experience management platform for retail and media, launched its first annual <a href=\"https://www.sailthru.com/personalization-index/sailthru100/\">Personalization Index</a>. Currently they’re only focused on retail (Sephora ranked #1 on the top 100 ranked list, in case you were wondering), but the lessons learnt almost certainly apply generally.</p> <p>There were three takeaways for businesses:</p> <ol> <li>A personalized user experience is a higher quality experience</li> <li>Focus your personalization strategy on what makes you - and your users - unique</li> <li>Don’t focus on just one channel, but strengthen the user experience across all touch points</li> </ol> <h2>Silver bullet?</h2> <p>Does this mean the verdict for improving your user experience is definitively in? Can we all conclude that more personalization is the way forward, and that the forty-four percent of publishers who say it’s not a top priority are missing a trick?</p> <p>Not necessarily. It's important to recognize that the situation for Sephora is different to that of a publishing or media business. There are good reasons why retail brands star in this new Personalization Index: publishers and media have different products and models. For a start, online retailers often have stronger data signals from their users in the form of purchase histories.</p> <p>Personalization is often presented as a silver bullet to solve all your problems in audience engagement and retention, but let’s take a look at the ballistic effectiveness in the publishing and media universe.</p> <h2>What makes you, you?</h2> <p>Firstly, we can agree that some of the content you create, all of your users should see. I’m talking about that groundbreaking investigative story, exclusive partner content or flagship new course.</p> <p>It’s The New York Times’ <em>Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades</em>, Netflix's <em>Stranger Things</em> and your own defining content that embodies what your site is all about. Poorly implemented personalization will hide this from your audience.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mike-dyer.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Dyer\"> <figcaption>Mike Dyer, former president and publisher, The Daily Beast</figcaption> </figure> <p>You need to be aware of your mission as well. “Journalism companies have a public good mission to confront people with fact-based reporting regardless of how they feel about it”, said Mike Dyer, former president and publisher of The Daily Beast, in <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/news-not-netflix-personalizations-appeal-remains-uncertain-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">a 2017 interview</a>. “[T]oo much personalization or content matching can harm that mission.”</p> <p>For the news media, their editorial choices are part of their product. Moving away from what makes you stand out is likely to turn off users and commoditize your offering, as The New York Times found out and I discuss below.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is absolutely connected to Sailthru’s second takeaway about focusing on what makes you unique. It’s important to have your brand shine through remarkable, distinctive content. You should also consider whether you have the responsibility to deepen and broaden the perspective and experiences of your users. Personalizing the entire content experience can build echo chambers.</p> <h2>Going halfway</h2> <p>A second thing to consider when you're planning on more personalization is whether you actually know enough about your users to make a more personalized experience possible? As Andrew Stothert, CEO at Brand Vista <a href=\"http://brand-vista.com/posts/view/making-sense-of-personalisation-just-because-we-can-does-it-mean-we-should\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a> on the topic: “Without the full picture, you are in danger of making stuff up. A strategy that will never bode well with something as business critical as the customer experience.”</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-andrew-stothert.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Stothert\"> <figcaption>Andrew Stothert, CEO, Brand Vista</figcaption> </figure> <p>Don’t force people down a siloed content path based on limited data from a single source such as browser history, location or device type. If you don’t have enough information about your user, don’t make the mistake of narrowing their whole experience from the get-go.</p> <p>Besides, sometimes it's simply not possible to tailor your content to each individual user’s attributes. This can be down to your monetization model, the tech situation or philosophical and ethical considerations. In the survey I mentioned, Digiday discovered that more than half of publishers can only adapt their content to the page context, and not to individual users.</p> <p>A user also doesn’t wear the same hat every time she or he visits you. It’s important to realize than an individual has different personas, with divergent goals and preferences. Jane at 10pm on a weekend doesn't want to see the same content as Jane at 10am on a Monday. Clumsy personalization conflates these personas and can actually harm your attempts to show people the right thing.</p> <p>If you’re in a situation where individual users’ attributes are not available, don't despair. There are still many ways to make sure that you serve relevant content and optimize the user experience.</p> <h2>Making the most of every page</h2> <p>One way to optimize without needing to personalize is to display on-page content recommendations. These can be based on the content and context of the page. With around 80% of external traffic to sites coming from search and social, it's important that your article pages can show off all the other great content on your site.</p> <p>Picture a side panel that allows for more ‘diverse’ discovery throughout your site - e.g. a way to explore a wider range of topics. It’s for users who didn’t make it to the end of the article but could be interested in one of your trending or evergreen articles. You could also offer end-of-article recommendations that enable deeper discovery into that particular topic. And what about inline recommendations that for example focus on a specific organization, geographic location or topic mentioned in the paragraph above?</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"http://www.bibblio.org/blog/making-most-of-every-page\" target=\"_blank\">Making the most of every page</a></p> <p>Another way to optimize without personalizing is to make recommendations based on the behavior of your audience as a whole, rather than individual users. Maybe Jane at 10pm on the weekend is more like Jim and Angela at that time than she is like herself on Monday at 10am. Look at what the rest of your audience likes at that point and you might just find the best thing for her.</p> <p>This also works because studying audience level data gives you an insight into the journeys your users are taking through your content. The aggregated data can show you the pathways which users enjoy the most, which can then be replicated in the suggestions the recommender system makes. This audience-based approach can be very effective even where you lack the data required for effective personalization.</p> <h2>Optimization at scale?</h2> <p>Selecting, delivering and continuously updating the right content recommendations is a difficult and time-consuming task. If you consider the amount of content that publishing &amp; media sites produce, and changing audience behavior on top of that, then it’s clear that for a human this is going to be a hugely difficult task. A good content recommendation system that can analyze all content and update suggestions as new content is added is an obvious solution.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-data-network-effects.jpg\" alt=\"Data Network Effects\"></figure> <p>As well as using semantic technology to understand the meaning and context of a piece of content, the best systems are driven by machine learning. This is what enables them to learn from anonymous user behavior and take the audience-based approach that I've set out above. It's a scalable, algorithmic approach that can throw up surprising results that a human would never intuitively pick.</p> <h2>Your personal way forward</h2> <p>The third and last point I want to make is on the potential disconnect between personalization and your users’ agency. Do your users actually want to see more and more targeted content?</p> <p>When The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/public-editor/a-community-of-one-the-times-gets-tailored.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> their plan to further personalize their site and apps in March last year, there was an uproar among readers. More than 300 comments came in (before they closed down the comment section), and the vast majority were against indulging readers rather than giving them the benefit of the Times' editorial expertise. The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/public-editor/a-community-of-one-the-times-gets-tailored.html#permid=21860513\" target=\"_blank\">following</a> note was voted ‘top’ comment:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-silver-bullet-nyt1.png\" alt=\"Top comment from the backlash against The New York Times' personalization plans\"></figure> <p>I recommend you go through the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/public-editor/a-community-of-one-the-times-gets-tailored.html#permid=21860638\" target=\"_blank\">Readers’ Picks</a> and read the passionate replies, such as this one on the importance of individual agency and bursting your filter bubble:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-silver-bullet-nyt2.png\" alt=\"A Readers' Pick comment from The New York Times' personalization plans announcement\"></figure> <h2>Handle with care</h2> <p>Personalization can be a powerful tool, but it's unlikely to be a silver bullet for user engagement challenges at the moment. Here are some thoughts to summarize:</p> <ul> <li>Investigate whether your audience has an appetite for a more tailored experience and if so, where on your site?</li> <li>Think carefully about how much of the experience you want to personalize, and based on which data?</li> <li>Strengthen the whole experience and always offer different discovery routes on your pages - don't assume you know what your audience wants. Try a variety of approaches, such as offering suggestions based on similar article context or evergreen status.</li> <li>If you move forward with (more) personalization, then a recommender system that adapts to changing goals and preferences is a must. If you don’t move forward with personalization, an adaptive system should still be part of your user experience plans.</li> <li>Be transparent with your users about why they're seeing what they're seeing, and give them the power to influence it if you can - perhaps they actually want to see what you think is important, and not what you think they might want.</li> </ul>",

    "post_content": "<p>What recirculation can tell you about user loyalty and how you can increase it</p> <!--more--> <p>If there’s one thing that the last year has confirmed, it’s that for the publishing industry the 'duopoly' is real. In a recent study, Parse.ly <a href=\"https://blog.parse.ly/post/6605/google-referrals-amp-traffic/\">reported</a> that, as well as hoovering up practically all ad revenue growth, about 70% of all external referral traffic to media sites comes from Google and Facebook too.</p> <p>This iron grip on digital ad revenue makes publishers vulnerable, and many are trying to <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/pivot-reality-digital-media/\">move away</a> from being purely ad-supported businesses. As they strive to establish more diverse revenue streams, including premium options such as subscription, it's vital for publishers to cultivate a more engaged and loyal audience.</p> <p>But how can you tell whether you’re doing the right things to turn your one-time Facebook visitors into devoted regulars?</p> <h2>Recirculation</h2> <p>An insightful way of measuring your success in creating a loyal audience, your 'loyalty metric', is looking at&nbsp;<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recirculation.</span></i></p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://mediashift.org/2017/12/recirculation-key-metric-news-publishers-2018/\"> MediaShift article</a>, Andrew Sweeney, marketing content manager at a digital analytics company, defines recirculation as the percentage of users who visit another page of your site after they finish reading their first article. The best way to understand the metric is as the inverse of Google Analytics’ bounce rate.</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“Recirculation numbers show you whether your users are hungry for more satisfying content on your site instead of skipping away for their next bite.”</i><br> - Andrew Sweeney</p> </blockquote> <p>By focusing on recirculation, Andrew writes, you can not only examine whether or not an article is performing well on average, but you can also begin to understand which pages your users are likely to visit next.</p> <h2>Turning knowledge into action</h2> <p>Knowing something is one thing, getting results is another. Being aware of which is the best follow-up article is interesting, but it only becomes useful if you can turn that knowledge into effective action. One simple way to do this is by making life easier for your users: add the best articles as links on your pages.</p> <p>Displaying relevant links in the sidebar, inline or at the bottom of each page will increase your recirculation numbers. Users will engage more with your content and ‘spend’ more time with your product and brand. This should kick off a powerful, positive feedback loop of them returning to your site more often.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dig-deeper-key.jpg\" alt=\"Making the most of every visit is key!\"></figure> <p>Andrew writes that adding these ‘read more links’ to your article pages sounds obvious, but asks “when was the last time you considered how well you use these links?” These shouldn’t be an afterthought - they’re an important route to higher revenue.</p> <h2>Choosing the best links</h2> <p>Selecting the best links to include on every article page is not an easy task. If you look at the amount of content that publishing sites produce, and consider subtly changing user behavior on top of that, then it’s clear that finding the best link for a page isn’t simple. In fact, you should consider whether it’s even a job for a human.</p> <p>Links chosen by humans have two main drawbacks. Firstly, they’re static or ‘hard-coded’. This means that if your audience’s preferences change, or you add content to your site that’s more appropriate as a link on a particular page, those links do not update. They can quickly go stale. Secondly, humans aren’t always able to spot what will perform best as a related link - our intuition can often let us down.</p> <p>Usually a sophisticated algorithmic solution that can test links to find the most effective, and then update them as your audience and content changes, will be better at the task of picking links than any person. When you consider the worth of your editorial staff’s time, it will often be cheaper too. This solution is known as a content recommendation system - although you need to be careful, as some ad-networks try to pose as content recommendation systems too.</p> <h2>Highly recommended</h2> <p>A good recommendation system selects links based upon data insights about the content, audience behavior and the individual user. The system adapts as new content comes in, the interests of your readership changes and the goals of the individual users become clearer.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-dig-deeper-ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"The ingredients of a good recommendation\"></figure> <p>The ability to adapt links based on the goals and preferences of the individual user is a key advantage of algorithms - it’s also something that a human could never do at scale. A good recommender system will adapt and get better at displaying the right content to the right user. The right content in this context is content that delivers both high recirculation numbers and highly engaged behavior on the suggested pages.</p> <p>If you don't hold any data about new or returning users, then using the insights you've gathered in a specific ‘session’ (i.e. period of time spent on your site by a user) can also be useful. A single session can cover an extended time period, e.g. a day, and the system could use a device ID or IP address to connect a session with a particular user.</p> <h2>Doing the right thing</h2> <p>It’s now relatively simple to choose an adaptive system that inserts engaging and relevant articles onto your pages without you having to lift a finger.

With <a href=\"https://www.eugdpr.org\" target=\"_blank\">GDPR</a> about to come into force, adtech vendors are also seeing their clients requesting alternatives to the programmatic models they usually push.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">Add to that brands pulling their ads from YouTube because of fears about brand safety, and the picture is one of people asking serious questions about the future of the ad-funded revenue model.</span></p> <p>Finding new revenue streams has never been so crucial for online publishers, but the audience can’t be the losers in the fight to stay competitive - reader engagement and loyalty have to be priorities.</p> <p>On Santa’s “Nice” list you’ll find the people who took a chance on innovative and different business strategies in 2017 - increasing their engagement by improving their user experience. On the other hand, anyone doubling down on shady data usage practices and aggressive ad models is looking at a lump of coal in their stocking and a place on the \"Naughty\" list.</p> <p>So who ended up in Santa's good and bad books this year?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-nice.png\" alt=\"The Nice List\"></figure> <h4>Slate</h4> <p>The first gold star goes to publishers who've moved away from the display-advertising model that has been ruining the internet since 1993:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/briefing/2017/11/were-making-slates-advertising-as-smart-as-its-content.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_ru\" target=\"_blank\">Slate</a> has been a great example. They're re-thinking their entire advertising strategy and making user-friendly changes:</p> <ul> <li>instructing their editorial team to focus on ‘total engaged minutes’ - i.e. users actually enjoying their experience - and not simply maximizing revenue per page view</li> <li>making sure their video ad formats are autoplay muted, because “I love being interrupted by loud, unwanted content” said nobody ever</li> <li>labelling their ad units so that they are easily distinguishable from editorial content</li> <li>improving their UX by having all their top-of-the-page ads at a maximum height of 250 pixels to make sure the page won’t shift when the ad loads</li> </ul> <br> <h4>Dazed</h4> <p>In the spirit of better UX, <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/dazeds-redesign-cut-ads-people-staying-lot-longer/\" target=\"_blank\">Dazed</a> also gets on the list for redesigning its website and cutting out display ads. The result? Time on site increased by 21%.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-dazed.jpg\" alt=\"Dazed\"> <figcaption>Dazed - users are not confused.</figcaption> </figure> <h4>Google</h4> <p>We never imagined Google would make the Nice list... In fact, all the Google-bashing that was the backdrop to this year's Ad Week in London over brand safety would normally be enough to send them straight to <a href=\"http://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/meet-the-the-krampus-austrias-favorite-nightmare-before-christmas-1601669.html\" target=\"_blank\">Krampus</a>. But, credit where credit’s due - Google’s new <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-will-help-publishers-prepare-for-a-chrome-ad-blocker-coming-next-year-1496344237?mod=e2tw\" target=\"_blank\">ad-blocking tool</a> should really improve the user experience on content sites.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>The New York Times</h4> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-nyt.png\" alt=\"The New York Times\"> <figcaption>The New York Times - doing it right.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Here at Bibblio, we value quality journalism over clickbait articles aimed at grabbing low-value attention. This is why we were thrilled to learn that The New York Times, the flagship for subscription journalism, <a href=\"https://www.nytco.com/year-of-audience/\" target=\"_blank\">has doubled their audience</a> in two years, with more than 3.5 million paid subscriptions and more than 130 million monthly readers.</p> <p>We predict this is just the acceleration of the trend of public support for membership models - people are prepared to pay for quality.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Editorial Integrity</h4> <p>2017 has been the year of initiatives to tackle the “Fake News” problem, which roared into the mainstream with the US elections. Publishers are working hard to find solutions, and ‘Fact-checking’ units have become popular - the BBC’s <a href=\"http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/01/13/bbc-establishes-dedicated-team-debunk-fake-facebook-twitter-stories\" target=\"_blank\">Reality Check</a> tool has become a permanent feature and Norwegian media organizations started a <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/norways-publishers-cooperating-quash-fake-news/\" target=\"_blank\">fact-checking collaboration</a>.</p> <p>British publishers also experimented with bots to provide voters accurate and diverse information in the run-up to the general election on June 8, and credit to The Times for launching the “<a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/uk-pubs-enlist-bots-fight-filter-bubbles-ahead-uk-election/\" target=\"_blank\">filter-bubble buster</a>” to try to get people to read articles outside of their comfort zone.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-naughty.png\" alt=\"The Naughty List\"></figure> <h4>Revcontent</h4> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-revcontent.jpg\" alt=\"Revcontent\"> <figcaption>Revcontent - nuff said.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Unfortunately, the fight against fake news attracted some opportunistic hangers-on. Ad-serving platform Revcontent launched a “<a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170601006612/en/Revcontent-Launches-%E2%80%98Truth-Media-Initiative%E2%80%99-Industry-First-Content\" target=\"_blank\">Truth in Media</a>” initiative, encouraging users to flag content they considered fake news. This ‘initiative’ ended up being a single extra button in the dropdown allowing users to flag content as inappropriate. This clumsy attempt at a rebrand, which <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/ad-driven-recommendation-doesnt-care-about-the-truth-and-that-isn-t-going-to-change-2de5d6648923\" target=\"_blank\">we’ve discussed before</a>, was pretty transparently nothing more than a data-gathering exercise to find out exactly what their users will tolerate.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Taboola</h4> <p>Taboola continues to chase after Facebook’s audience in the desperate race for clicks. They've been struggling to keep readers on their users' sites, as they quickly bounce and return to their Facebook feed. Could this have anything to do with the clickbait-y nature and low quality of Taboola’s external links? Not according to their CEO, who wants to address the problem by featuring content recommendations in the form of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/taboola-intros-facebook-style-news-feed-to-target-mobile-users-with-more-links/\" target=\"_blank\">continuously scrolling list</a>, a new take on, well, Facebook’s news feed.</p> <p>For all of us who hoped 2017 was going to mark the end of endless feedback loops encouraging unhealthy behaviour, maybe 2018 will be our year.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Amazon</h4> <p>Amazon has recently stepped up its efforts to become a media player, and one way that it’s doing that is by leaning on publishing partners for content. That’s led to a <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/amazons-media-ambitions-grow-publishers-wary-dedicating-resources/\" target=\"_blank\">deterioration of its relationship with partners</a>, many of whom are tired of meeting the company’s demands only to see little return on their investment. As it turns out, Amazon’s primary goals of growing its e-commerce business and Prime membership program often conflict with publishers’ goals of growing audience and consumer revenue. Who’d have thought that Amazon might not have publishers’ best interests at heart?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Google (again)</h4> <p>It probably comes as no surprise that Google would be on our Naughty list too... YouTube has been losing support from users and brands alike after a series of high-profile missteps: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/25/google-youtube-advertising-extremist-content-att-verizon\" target=\"_blank\">ad boycott</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/21/youtube-google-advertising-policies-controversial-content\" target=\"_blank\">de-monetization algorithm</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2\" target=\"_blank\">scandal of YouTube Kids</a>. Though the tech giant is trying to make amends, it's unfortunate that it seems to only find its conscience just as soon as its revenue is threatened. Brands will come back to YouTube, but in the meantime some content creators will need to look for other ways to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Facebook</h4> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-nice-naughty-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook\"> <figcaption>Facebook - all sorts of wrong.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Oh Facebook.

It's a dangerous world out there, and it's not as if anybody else is providing a secure messaging service for the under-13s...</p> <p>This certainly wasn't to get children addicted to the platform at as young an age as possible so as to monetize their online behavior and make up for <span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">waning growth.

    "post_content": "<p>Bibblio co-founder Mads Holmen was at the The AI Summit in New York last week with the Department of International Trade, explaining how recommendations powered by AI have become a driving force in digital content. Read on to find out what it's worth to Netflix, and how we ended up in a war for attention.</p> <!--more--> <p>\"Hello guys, I’m here to talk about content recommendation and AI. It’s something we all interact with every day, but you might not be aware of this. So, let me give you a quick introduction. One of our clients is AFAR.com - a travel site. They’re a nice example of how sites can use content recommendation to engage users. Someone is reading an article, they get to the bottom of the page and, rather than just a blank space, there's some more content suggested to them:</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-afar.jpg\" alt=\"AFAR.com's recommendations\"> <figcaption>Content recommendations at the bottom of articles on <a href=\"http://afar.com\" target=\"_blank\">afar.com</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>\"Bibblio’s role here is powering the AI that's figuring out what should be suggested to each user. Now that I’ve given you a frame of reference, I actually want to start by rewinding a little. The story of recommendations is far bigger than Bibblio and our clients: it’s really the story of the web as a whole. About ten years ago, if you spoke to any of the big websites they would say that 80 or 90% of their traffic came directly to their site. These days, that same 80 to 90% is coming through Google or social media. Most of the content we now consume is ‘recommended’ - I’ll come back to this later - by one of those sources.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-traffic.jpg\" alt=\"The article page is the new front page\"></figure> <p>\"This pattern of consumption has disrupted the way sites work, because most people rarely go to the ‘front page’ any more: they land straight on a piece of content. So, we jokingly say the content page is actually the new front page, because that’s where the majority of users land. That’s changed the way sites need to operate, unless they want to end up at the mercy of the big platforms as just search results and social media links. They need to really invest in their article pages, because they only get that one page to try to engage people - to turn one page view into two and create loyal subscribers in the future.</p> <p>\"More broadly, what this actually highlights is that there’s a real war going on for online attention, and the search and social giants are winning. This is Herbert Simon. In 1971, he looked into his crystal ball and said these words: “Information consumes the attention of its recipients.” He was right, and it follows that when the amount of information increases exponentially, the attention span of recipients must curve the other way.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-simon.jpg\" alt=\"The war for attention\"></figure> <p>\"Lo and behold, when we look across the web now, users spend over 10 billion hours every week on Instagram, Netflix, YouTube and Facebook, and increasingly less time in other places. In many ways, these companies have taken control over the rest of the content ecosystem. In the publishing and media world they’re often called <em>frenemies</em>, and that’s being pretty friendly.</p> <p>\"I call this situation the 100-billion-dollar question, because that’s about the amount of money Google and Facebook have taken out of the publishing world in the last ten years. And it goes further: Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, recently said that their biggest competitor is now sleep. At the end of the day, anything that consumes someone’s attention is increasingly competing with everything else. And at some point, if you’re scrolling enough on Facebook and Instagram, that competition becomes sleep, or time with friends or your better half, and everybody suffers. There are only 24 hours in a day, and time is the one truly finite commodity that humans have.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-social.jpg\" alt=\"10 billion hours a week on social media\"></figure> <p>\"At the moment – and I’ve spent 10 years in the online advertising industry – we, people, are being sold as a commodity. Our time and attention is aggregated and sold. To capture more and more of it these companies are using content recommendation systems.</p> <p>\"Think about Facebook’s newsfeed. It’s a recommendation engine. In fact, over 85% of time that people spend on these platforms is a result of algorithmic recommendations. It’s a never-ending personalized feed, a never-ending personalized reflection of what you’ve liked in the past. And we’re being fed more and more.</p> <p>\"Netflix actually quantified what content recommendation means to them annually: one billion dollars - and that was last year, the figure’s almost certainly higher now. That’s about 12% of their revenue attributed to content recommendation. So recommendation is good for business. But what is a good recommendation?</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"The ingredients of a good recommendation\"></figure> <p>\"This is something I can talk about for hours, but I’ll give you a very brief intro. There are broadly three things that matter to a recommendation. Firstly, understanding the content – specifically, its relevance to other content. So say I’m reading an article on North Korea, perhaps I’m interested in reading more about this topic. At Bibblio we use a whole bunch of semantic analysis, topic modelling and clustering algorithms to figure out which content is most relevant at that moment to the piece that you’re reading about North Korea.</p> <p>\"Secondly, there’s understanding generalized user behavior. The best example is probably the way Amazon recommends products – others users who liked that item you’re looking at also like this. It’s actually not a true personalization algorithm, but a general behavioral one.</p> <p>\"Thirdly and finally, you can’t do without the truly personalized models. Personalization, understanding users at the individual level, is really hard. Algorithms are still not very good at understanding humans. But a great example here is Facebook Newsfeed. It looks at about 120 signals to figure out what it should show every individual.</p> <p>\"Where AI really features in content recommendation is in the data network effects. The more behavioral and user data we get, the better we can train the models. This raises some very interesting ethical questions. What should recommendation do? Should it give people more and more of the stuff they like, or should it also sometimes challenge them? Perhaps we need to show them stuff even when we don’t know if they are going to ‘like’ it, because if you keep just showing people more of what they like, they might never know what else is out there.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-mads-aisummit-effects.jpg\" alt=\"Our recommendation AI delivers improved results for both users and publishers over time\"></figure> <p>\"One of the most fascinating things about recommendations is that whenever we choose to show people something, we also choose not to show them a whole bunch of other stuff. We’re making very real choices here that are beginning to shape people’s worlds. I won’t dive deep into fake news right now. One thing I do want to say though is that things like the Facebook Newsfeed algorithm have done a lot to encourage publishers to create sugary content that gets clicked on and shared but which might not be very good for people.</p> <p>\"We talk a lot about an obesity epidemic in the physical world: we have also an obesity epidemic in the digital world! We get fed a lot of sugary content that’s designed to drive clicks and shares but doesn’t help users stay ‘healthy’ or follow any ethical guidelines. How sustainable is this in the long run?</p> <p>\"This talk has hopefully given you a bit of insight into why recommendations are important. Get in touch if you’re interested in finding out how recommendations can lift your site’s performance, drive better engagement or want to know more about the clients we’re working with. If content is your main product, you should speak to us! Thank you.\"</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>Is ignorance bliss?</p> <!--more--> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Algorithms are now embedded in our daily lives, and they structure our social worlds in ways that are often barely noticeable. One example is recommender systems, which play a role in who we meet, what music we listen to, what we eat... They’re also responsible for some of our most extravagant-but-completely-unnecessary purchases, recommending the right product to us at exactly the right time. They might even influence how we’re seen in our circle of friends by giving us the right article to share. <br><br>As these digital products get more advanced, the technology actually driving them becomes less visible. This can make for a more intuitive user experience, but it also means that the algorithms end up living secret lives behind the interfaces we use. Each one is a black box with a complex set of inputs and outputs, capable of finding results for almost anything in a few milliseconds when it can take us an hour to find something to wear in the morning.<br><br>Of course there’s the occasional algorithmic mishap... A family of New Yorkers gets a visit from the police after their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/01/new-york-police-terrorism-pressure-cooker\" target=\"_blank\">web search history</a> demonstrates an interest in pressure cookers and backpacks. A dad finds out about his daughter’s pregnancy after Target’s predictive algorithms send her baby product <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_not_to_be_wrong/2014/06/09/big_data_what_s_even_creepier_than_target_guessing_that_you_re_pregnant.html\" target=\"_blank\">coupons</a>. YouTube’s autoplay system shares hundreds of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamesbridle/something-is-wrong-on-the-internet-c39c471271d2\" target=\"_blank\">disturbing videos</a> with young children who watch their beloved Peppa Pig get tortured by her dentist. And as we give our explanations to the police or drag our screaming children to the dentist, we realize two things: 1) algorithms have very real repercussions in our lives beyond Spotify’s ‘Discover Weekly’ playlist, and 2) considering how ubiquitous algorithms have become, most of us know very little about how they work and what they’re capable of.<br><br>We can’t lift the lid and have a look at what’s inside the black box though. Frank Pasquale calls this the ‘One-Way Mirror’ of Big Data. Companies have a wealth of data about how we interact with media, using it to improve their products or to sell to advertising agencies for targeting, but we know little to nothing about how they use this knowledge to influence the important decisions that we — and they — make. The result is that our trust in the black boxes is gradually diminishing. It’s simple: if we keep giving away information about ourselves and only get exploited in return, our faith in the algorithms and the companies will disappear.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-secret-life-superman.jpg\" alt=\"Tech firms are a one-way mirror\"> <figcaption>Yes Clark, tech firms know who you are</figcaption> </figure> <h2>Metrics Matter</h2> <p>One thing we can see upon looking closer at the world of algorithms is that the fuzzy stuff our social world is made of has been translated into hard data and quantifiable metrics. Our complex cinematic preferences are boiled down to categories like “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/\" target=\"_blank\">Cult Evil Kid Horror Movies</a>” on Netflix. In a society that increasingly tries to break down our social lives into data that can be computed, things that cannot be counted are becoming invisible.<br><br>Engagement is measured in claps, likes, shares and clicks. This data then forms the algorithmic feedback loop that determines what we see and what remains hidden, what makes the first page and what gets lost in the ocean of SEO. All this then shapes the way we see the world around us. For every search result that appears on top of your list, there are billions that didn’t make the cut.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-secret-life-blackbox.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Box Society by Frank Pasquale\"> <figcaption>The Black Box Society by Frank Pasquale</figcaption> </figure> <p><br>How we measure what gets shown matters. For example, do we want popularity to be the only path to algorithmic success? No matter how popular articles about the royal engagement are, they're no good as recommendations to people who don't like the monarchy. To paraphrase George Orwell, all metrics are equal, but some are more equal than others. Popularity as a metric is also easy to manipulate and doesn’t guarantee quality or relevance. Last year, marketing manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/04/egonomics-social-media-online-image-amazon\" target=\"_blank\">Brent Underwood</a> uploaded a photo of his foot as a cover for a self-published, one-page book and asked friends to buy it on Amazon – it became a ‘bestseller’. It only got three sales, but it was in the ‘Freemasonry’ category; that’s how easy it is to game the system. Brent can now tell everyone he has written an Amazon bestseller.<br><br>In the rush to try and make human satisfaction quantifiable and measurable, many companies have settled for metrics that are easy to record, like clicks. We need to find ones that actually tell the whole story about what users want and need.</p> <h2>Next stop… where?</h2> <p>There has been a lot of recent <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/silicon-valley-has-a-problem-problem-b34437a57e99\" target=\"_blank\">criticism</a> over Silicon Valley losing touch with the real world, but that isn’t going to stop tech companies playing a central role in deciding what tomorrow will look like. The power of algorithms not just to guess preferences, but to actually shape them, has created the prospect of these tools being used to harvest more and more data and alter users’ behavior with greater and greater success. This is worrying in a situation where fewer and fewer of us trust them to act in our best interests.</p> <p><br><em>“Big data driven decisions may lead to unprecedented profits. But once we use computation not merely to exercize power over things, but also over people, we need to develop a much more robust ethical framework than [the industry] is now willing to entertain.</em>” - Frank Pasquale</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-secret-life-better.gif.gif\" alt=\"A better place\"></figure> <p><br>Everybody working to build these powerful algorithms needs to think carefully about the goals and metrics they optimize for, because they will shape the world around us, whether in the way we intend or not. We need to take a new approach to this technology that really works for users. It needs to be transparent and it needs to work towards goals that users really want.</p> <p><br>Transparency and accountability are key values companies need to keep in mind when building algorithms and translating fuzzy social concepts into quantifiable data. It’s not straightforward, and unconscious bias can also find its way into machine learning data sets very easily, for example in a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/machines-taught-by-photos-learn-a-sexist-view-of-women/\" target=\"_blank\">photo data-set which has lots of images of women cooking.</a></p> <p><br><a href=\"https://www.fatml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FAT/ML</a> is one example of an organization working to tackle issues like fairness and accountability in machine learning. Researchers and people in business have joined forces to analyse failures in machine learning models and ensure that ‘the algorithm made me do it’ doesn’t become the default excuse for decision-making failures with systems reliant on machine learning. Transparency with algorithmic technology is essential to creating systems that work for humans, rather than exploiting them. As one of their studies reported, users are more willing to trust recommender systems with a transparent UI that offers them some way to judge the appropriateness of recommendations. &nbsp;</p> <h2>What do we really want?</h2> <p>When developing an algorithm, it’s also necessary to really consider what the metrics being optimized for say about user behavior. With an engagement model based on views, incidents like YouTube and Peppa Pig occur, especially with ‘similarity of keywords’ enough to qualify as relevance. Focusing on just one dimension of what makes ‘good’ content will often come at the cost of looking at the bigger picture. ‘Engagement’ has become something of a buzzword in any case, since it can mean so many things – from clicks, to time-spent, or most-shared – without telling us much about the user experience.</p> <h2>What if we tried to optimize for real user satisfaction instead?</h2> <p><a href=\"http://learn.parsely.com/rs/314-EBB-255/images/authority-report-14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Parse.ly</a> is&nbsp;looking at a creative re-evaluation of what ‘engagement’ actually means. They are proposing a new metric of ‘engaged time’ which measures the reader’s activity over three “<em>heartbeats</em>”, rather than stopping at the click.

    "post_content": "<p>For most publishers, the home page is dying - long live the article page? More and more readers are bypassing publishers’ home pages and going directly to content through links from Google, social feeds and aggregators.</p> <strong><!--more--></strong> <p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">For over half of publishers, the homepage generates fewer than 10% of article views (Source:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.parse.ly/resources/data-studies/authority-report-11/\" style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Parse.ly</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">). Our own publishing partners confirm this trend, reporting that on average only 8% of visitors enter their sites via the homepage.</span></p> <p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Readers are entering your site through ‘side doors’ – the links on Google, Facebook etc. that we mentioned above. This means that publishers will have to adapt. Search, social and other referral sources help you increase traffic to popular content, but with that traffic comes a high bounce rate. How can you get readers to stick around instead of bouncing back to Facebook?</span></p> <p>As Lawrence Horne, Managing Director at Time Out Group, <a href=\"http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/articles/the-homepage-is-dead-it-s-all-about-article-pages/2763\" target=\"_blank\">puts it</a>: <span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">“Modern article pages are telling stories through big imagery, videos, animations, transitions, interactive elements and, of course, compelling editorial.” These page designs are great for getting lost in a storyline and driving one-time visitors, Horne explains, but “they don’t do a great job of creating a relationship with the reader or recommending the next article to read.”</span></p> <p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Articles pages can’t <em>just</em> tell great stories anymore. Now they also have to perform the function of a homepage. That is, they have to position the brand, set the site’s tone, encourage readers to subscribe to a newsletter and, crucially, promote more of the site’s great content.</span></p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-make-most-pennies.png\" alt=\"Getting pennies back\"></figure> <p>But that isn’t what’s happening. In their attempts to maximize revenue per page view, plenty of websites have forgotten the reader. One striking example of this is ‘recommendation’ networks such as Taboola and Outbrain, displaying articles from clickbait sites as ‘related content’ at the bottom of your page. This is a terrible use of valuable site real estate. It devalues your site, tarnishes your brand, prompts readers to leave your site, and, even worse, feel cheated afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want readers to keep reading your content, you have to respect them and the content experience. Start investing in your brand, build a relationship with your readers and help them find more of your own great content:</p> <p><i>“Surely websites should want to keep readers, understand their viewing habits and redirect them around their own site’s relevant content, not push them away to another to look at, for example, the “Top 10 fun parks that have closed down”!” - </i><a href=\"http://digitalmarketingmagazine.co.uk/articles/the-homepage-is-dead-it-s-all-about-article-pages/2763\"><i>Lawrence Horne</i></a></p> <h2>Keeping readers engaged&nbsp;</h2> <p>What’s the best way to help readers find relevant content that they really want to read? Well, the premium content companies (think Spotify, The Washington Post and Netflix) use real recommendations for their users, not just a ‘most popular’ list. How do they do it? A good recommendation draws upon insights into the following dimensions: a) the content, b) audience behaviour and c) the individual reader.&nbsp;Let’s think about why.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-make-most-ingredients.jpg\" alt=\"The ingredients of a good recommendation\"> <figcaption>The ingredients of a good recommendation</figcaption> </figure> <p>Understanding more about the content allows you to offer more relevant recommendations. There are tools available to help you do this, for example natural language processing APIs that can understand sentiment, reading level, keywords, high-level thematic concepts and more. When you really understand what the content is about it becomes easier to find relevant pieces from the rest of your content.</p> <p>Audience behaviour data tells you about the journeys your readers are taking through your content. This aggregated data can inform recommendations so that they help to replicate the pathways which readers enjoy the most. The same recommendations made in a different order might turn out to be a lot more compelling.</p> <p>Lastly, insights into individual readers will help you to personalize recommendations and make them even better. If you don't hold any data about new or returning readers, then using the insights you've gathered on the specific article they're reading when they enter your site can also be useful. Allow the reader to have control of what to read next, e.g. do they want to dig deeper into a certain topic or explore something else?</p> <p>Recommendations are often heavily skewed towards just one of the many dimensions that go into making a good recommendation. An example of this is a ‘Most Popular’ widget, which displays the articles with the most views, likes, shares etc. in a particular period of time. This usually ignores the relevance of what’s being suggested to the reader’s actual goals or interests.</p> <p>Good recommended content honours your brand, readers’ interests and opens pathways to your commercial goals. Do you run advertising and/or sponsored content? A good recommendation increases the chances of a click on one of these ads. Does your site have a store? Recommendations help people find more items to purchase and increase your basket size. The same goes for a premium publishing offering which is looking to encourage users to sign up to a paid-for subscription.</p> <p>Recommending your own content allows you to track and map reader ‘sessions’ to a commercial conversion event on your website. Smart recommender systems can use this data to improve your content suggestions, boosting your conversion numbers.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Mini home page</h2> <p>If your article pages tell great stories, and you can use them to help the reader find other great content on your site, then every article page can become a mini home page. More visitors will turn into regulars and spend time on your site, subscribe to newsletters and premium offers and spend money on your site.</p> <p>Are you making the most of every page?

    "post_content": "<p>An interview with the founder of discovery platform Refind</p> <p>Content overload is taking its toll on users across the web. We asked Dominik Grolimund, CEO of Refind, about how building better content platforms can make it easier for people to find quality content without increasing background noise. On today’s menu: automated content curation, bursting the filter bubble, and the value behind community-driven projects.</p> <!--more--> <h2>Mental Junk Food</h2> <p>The diagnosis is in, and it's not looking good for web users. It turns out&nbsp;that binging on information might not be all that good for you when the system that delivers it is broken. Ev Williams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/10/twitter-ev-williams-medium-content-fast-food\" target=\"_blank\">warned us</a>&nbsp;about the dissatisfaction created by Twitter and Facebook&nbsp;churning out mental junk food, arguing that users would seek an alternative, more nourishing diet. Twitter’s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40740884\">stalling&nbsp;growth</a>&nbsp;and the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/11/facebook-google-public-health-democracy\" target=\"_blank\">criticism</a> stacking up against the Google/Facebook duopoly might be proving him right, and it's making us wonder: are users on a digital cleanse?</p> <p>Dominik Grolimund, founder of Refind, was certainly looking for an alternative. “I don’t read any news on the internet, but I still need it in a way to see what the most important thing was that I shouldn't miss. So I was very frustrated with the very bad signal-to-noise ratio on all platforms and I couldn't keep up, so my solution was to not read at all.” Burying our heads in the sand isn't a long-term solution:&nbsp;we still need to know what's happening around us. The issue is&nbsp;discovering content worth reading without having to dig into<span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\"> the internet's answer t</span>o a pile of greasy fries first.</p> <p>Enter content curation, a ‘less is more’ approach that cuts through the noise to quality content. One example is the briefings you receive from platforms like Medium, which ensure that you don't get stuck in an infinite scroll of content people clapped for. Another is romance seekers taking a break from Tinder to look for a soulmate on Coffee Meets Bagel, where a limited number of profiles are selected for you based on more relevant criteria than just physical proximity. Scaling curation without diluting&nbsp;the quality is a real challenge, and an algorithm can be essential to power recommendations and personalize curation at scale. At the end of the day, too much quality content is still too much: we need relevance.</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"http://www.bibblio.org/blog/a-crisis-of-attention-part-ii\" target=\"_blank\">A Crisis of Attention - Part II</a></p> <h2>A Recipe for Success</h2> <p>“I think it’s good that there is a place for entertainment and that place is called Facebook, or Instagram, or Snapchat. But I truly believe that there needs to be a place where the concept of relevance needs to be more explicit.”</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-refind-category.png\" alt=\"Refind's relevance\" width=\"320\"></figure> <p>Refind was born as an attempt to establish relevance as something that readers could value in its own right. Users not only receive content based on the interests they selected, but can also follow people and influence what’s on their reading list. Links across the web are analyzed based on a user’s personal relevance score to deliver a feed with no more than 50 slots. A healthy dose of what you are interested in, with a dash of serendipity. Like any passionate chef, Dominik didn't reveal his secret sauce when discussing the algorithm, but he did tell us about <span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">the type of data that they are looking for. One of the key ingredients? Links with a longer shelf-life:</span></p> <p>“We are not in a hurry to push out the link, since we are not a news platform. We give the link a little bit more time, going back to see what really stood out say, the last week or the last couple of days that you should know about.”</p> <p>When looking at the patterns of how users are saving links, a link with a spike in saves that quickly declines will get down ranked: instead, links that get consistently saved over time are prioritized. ‘Timeless over timely’ is Refind's fundamental approach to scoring content. The mos<span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">t important signal about user preference is&nbsp;</span>when a user deliberately saves a link on the platform or in their browser. This is a simple way to ensure content stays relevant when users check their feed.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-refind-break.png\" alt=\"Less is more\" width=\"320\"></figure> <p>The icing on the cake is Refind's solution to our complex relationship with the filter bubble. In fact,&nbsp;in the way it's organized around the two poles of ‘Interests’ and ‘People’, Refind is a great example of how a good system can help us tackle the issue of content diversity. It allows users a real breadth of topics and perspectives, by giving them a 360 view of what people they follow are interested in and making it possible for them to read about their niche interests without losing sight of the bigger picture. Dominik sees this as a unique strength of Refind:</p> <p>“The way Refind is structured ... it is a trade-off between exploitation and exploration, exploiting what you know about the user and exploring into new areas.”</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/the-war-for-attention-2da75d59bcfa\" target=\"_blank\">The War for Our Attention</a></p> <h2>The Human + Machine model</h2> <p>Beyond the filter bubble, Refind’s model provides an interesting solution to the ‘too many cooks’ problem of content recommendation. You see this problem when advertisers and editorial teams have too much say in what’s on the menu: users miss out on the bigger picture. Refind offers an algorithmically-generated feed, but the collected 'signals' are all manual actions by users, so they control what they want to see, not third parties.&nbsp;</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-refind-discover.jpg\" alt=\"Refind's suggestions\"></figure> <p>“We do not have an editorial board that sits there and decides what is a good link and what is a bad link, it should be done by the people, and you as the ultimate user decide which people you think are worth following.”</p> <p>Giving power back to the user is a daring and important move in a world where many publishers are tempted to only suggest popular content to chase clicks, a position Refind doesn't want to take. Dominik is adamant: “We are not gods. We cannot decide for everyone what is good content and bad content. This is very subjective.”</p> <p class=\"diversion\">Also read <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/clicks-vs-satisfaction-cc6a528b40ac\" target=\"_blank\">Clicks vs Satisfaction</a></p> <p>The combination of algorithm and user input is what can change the game, and solve common problems, like<span>&nbsp;fake news and extremist content,</span>&nbsp;giants like Facebook and Twitter still face. On the one hand, explicitly abusive content is moderated by Refind once it has been flagged by users. On the other, negative content that is not explicitly extremist or abusive will be saved less often by users, carry less weight, and therefore be less likely to make it into one of the user's 50 content slots. This is an organic form of content curation with no editorial intervention.</p> <h2>A community-driven project</h2> <p>We all get by with a little help from our friends, but Refind’s story really reads like a love letter to its community of users and supporters. Originally just an experiment amongst friends, Dominik turned it into a serious project once he discovered his tech-savvy peers were still using his platform weeks after he had invited them in as an occasional alternative to their news and social sites. Carefully listening to the support and feedback from the community is what elevated it from an idea to a start-up, with user data continuously bringing new insights as the platform evolves.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-refind-social.png\" alt=\"What if Google and Facebook gave away part of their success to early users?\" width=\"320\"></figure> <p>Determined to give back to the community, Refind’s <a href=\"http://relevance.community/\" target=\"_blank\">1-billion-coin campaign</a> is a way to break with the convention, created by&nbsp;players like&nbsp;YouTube and Facebook, of exploiting user data and labour without any compensation. Allowing people to buy into the company by giving away coins once they reach 10 million users not only ensures fast growth, but it also encourages a more cooperative and ethical version of B2C practices.</p> <p>“Firstly, it is a marketing strategy that focuses on growth: the more users and the more content, the more relevant the feed will become. Secondly, it is about giving back. Even before we launched the coins, we had a core group of users that really helped a lot, by giving feedback, by buying in etc. and I always wondered how I could thank them further down the line. I did not want to send them a t-shirt or a sticker because that felt really cheap, so the coin idea was really a way to thank the people that were helpful from the start to make it bigger. We can only give back if we succeed so growth is crucial.”</p> <h2>Turning up the heat</h2> <p>Eager to share the lessons he learned with fellow entrepreneurs, Dominik told us about the challenges his startup is facing. So far, the difficulties they have encountered are the result of their growing success and can be summed up quite simply: h<span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">ow to make good on their prom</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\">ise</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.5vmax; background-color: transparent;\"> to deliver relevant content with the limited resources of a startup?</span></p> <p>There are long-term projects aiming to maintain and improve the relevance of content for their growing user-base, which has evolved beyond the tech space to include a wider spectrum of personalities and interests. <span>Refind also has to make</span>&nbsp;sure it hosts quality content, which entails playing a cat-and-mouse game with spammers, who try to infiltrate the system to have their links appear on other people’s feeds.</p> <p>“With the introduction of coins, there are a lot of things that are flowing in on different channels and we are trying to be really good at keeping up with all these new things that are coming in whilst progressing the app and working on new features.”</p> <p>With Refind just kicking off, it'<span>s a challenge to&nbsp;</span>develop the product at the same time as supporting the community they are so proud of. Wanting to improve the mobile app and the search system has led them to automate certain operations, like customer support. To make that happen they're now getting in touch with people who share the same vision.</p> <h2>Food for thought</h2> <p>What can we take away from Refind’s story?</p> <ul> <li>The genuine interest sparked by Dominik’s idea proves there is a need for a more transparent form of content recommendation that gives end-users more control of what they see.</li> <li>This has important implications for the industry, as platforms like this speed up the advent of new ways to monetize content through channels like the coin issue (alongside premium memberships and ads on the search system).</li> <li>Refind as a case-study makes us hopeful for the future of online content. It demonstrates that it's possible to build a content platform with high user retention without creating addiction. It also answers Ev Williams’ call for solutions to the feedback loop driving the industry’s junk food addiction.</li> <li>We're convinced more platforms will follow with the same ideals towards more balanced access to information, because, as Dominik emphasizes, there's a place for everything, from gossip to news. It's not about imposing a certain way of consuming content on people, but about giving them choices and opening up access. We'll let Dominik have the last word:</li> </ul> <p>“In the end this is what we are trying to do, we are trying to make it as easy to get to relevant content as it is to get to fun and gossip.”</p> <p>Let’s get cooking, everyone.</p>",

This year’s convention, themed ‘Inside Out’, aimed to bring publishers and industry partners together to examine the challenges and opportunities driving the profitability and future of the digital publishing sector.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-brochure.jpg\" alt=\"Positive ad UX is THE way forward for the industry\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"></figure> <p>This blog post will zoom in on the third panel of the convention, titled <em>‘Positive ad UX is THE way forward for the industry’</em>. On this panel, our own Global Commercial Director <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alasdaircross/\" target=\"_blank\">Alasdair Cross</a> was joined by speakers from Celtra, Carat and The Telegraph to discuss the raising UX expectation. The panel was moderated by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dilip-shukla-24336a4/\" target=\"_blank\">Dilip Shukla</a>, Head of Content Strategy at AOP. Check out the transcript here:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Interacting with an audience</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “I’d like to invite the entire panel to join me on the stage. What we’ll try to do today is not focus on the concerns that may be a current industry preoccupation, but to think about where real value is created and share those ideas. Alasdair, to start with you, I’d like to hear your thoughts on what it is to interact with an audience or a person online? What you can learn from the way we can refer them to new ideas?”</p> <p><strong>Alasdair</strong>: “So, I guess first a brief elevator pitch here. Bibblio helps publishers to make the most of every page. What does that mean? We see a couple of big problems publishers experience. The first one has to do with the attention and the consumption of pages and its content. You see high bounce rates, low page views and attention and a large number of click-outs. So if we could help to get publishers longer dwell times and increased engagement on their own sites, then that’s a good thing. That’s going to increase loyalty and strengthen their brand.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-alasdair-cross.jpg\" alt=\"Alasdair Cross, Global Commercial Director for Bibblio, speaks at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention. Credit: AOP\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"> <figcaption>Alasdair Cross, Global Commercial Director for Bibblio, speaks at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention. Credit: AOP</figcaption> </figure> <p>“The second problem has to do with fairly large amounts of money being spent on traffic acquisition. Publishers will buy in traffic through social media and Google, and a large number leaks away to a variety of places. So if we can help publishers to retain the person for longer and also syndicate their content out to drive more relevant people back into their content, then that’s also going to help in their journey.</p> <p>“So in terms of ad UX. When you think about the huge rise in adblockers - even my kids installed it without a second thought - and trying to change that; it’s going to be hard problem to solve. I think we need to start with publishers first, by encouraging them to retain people for longer. This means thinking about the right format of their own content and ads on their pages. That’s going to bring positive results.”</p> <h2>Throwing data science into the mix</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “What type of patterns are you seeing? What’s the success formula of referring people to the next piece of content?”</p> <p><strong>Alasdair</strong>: “There are ways we can optimise. These ways have to do with the positioning of the recommendation modules on different parts of the page. Essentially, it’s about relevance. Relevance is king. If we can surface the most relevant content to the right person, we’re going to see the best results. At the moment it’s very early days. There’s data science being applied to work out what fits best for which person. All the results point at relevance being vital for success.”</p> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “It is black box science that defines the relevance? What kind of human input goes into it?”</p> <p><strong>Alasdair</strong>: “I think it’s both. Ultimately, if we can’t get people to engage longer on publisher’s content, then there’s a problem. The science comes into it when we need to measure the audience response. We’re looking at the engagement rates, the dwell time, the click-through rates. And that will feed into the science at the backend.”</p> <h2>There's only UX</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “Thank you, Alasdair. Next I’m going to invite Ian to share his thoughts on the subject. Where is the world of ad UX going?”</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/icurtis/\" target=\"_blank\">Ian Curtis</a></strong>, Product Manager at The Telegraph: “Thanks. The way I see it at The Telegraph is that none of our readers show up to any page to see ads. They show up for that specific article, that piece of content, either curated or written from scratch by a journalist. There’s a couple of things we need to do, to continue to produce that content. That’s either to generate some revenue from that page, which could be through subscription, registration, advertising or more commercial journeys such as financial services or travel.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-ian-curtis.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Curtis, Product Manager for The Telegraph, speaks at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention.

Credit: AOP</figcaption> </figure> <p>“Also, we need to make sure that the reader enjoys the piece of content, the experience a whole so much, that they want to come back or explore more in their limited time. That’s the balance we need to bear in mind.</p> <p>“I don’t think there’s any such thing as ad UX at all. I think there’s UX. A reader shows up at a site and we need to make sure that reader has the best experience possible. Or else there’s a huge possibility that reader will not come back. Or when they come back, they come back armed with an ad blocker or a level of paralysis that won’t allow them to engage with your brand. With that in mind, it becomes an extremely nuanced situation for publishers and brands. Everyone wants what’s right for that reader at any point. It’s important that ads are operational, they are fast and that they complement the content that we have in place at any time.”</p> <h2>Multivariate testing</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “Ok. Listening to this, I think we could have the chance to consider next level of advertising, where all the ads have a creative connection to the content. Is there a way we can start researching the effectiveness of that?”</p> <p><strong>Ian</strong>: “The gaps we create on the page to support advertising are built with the reader in the mind. We test everything through. We’ve been doing that for the last two years. We look for statistical significance through multivariate testing. So we know what it does for all revenue streams. So far as what goes into those gaps we’ve created, they need to be brand safe and score well on viewability. Both of them are not good measure of success, but if you’re not hitting those you’re doing something wrong.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-dilip-shukla.jpg\" alt=\"Dilip Shukla, Head of Content Strategy for AOP, moderates at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention.

At that moment we’ve gone through much testing, so whatever ends up being shown to the reader should be in the right context and be able to do the job it’s meant to do.”</p> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “I love the point of multivariate testing. Does it allow you to say ‘if that ad format is there doing this, it seems to compromise the experience, but if I do that then…’?”</p> <p><strong>Ian</strong>: “We use <i>Polar </i>for our native advertising. To create an ad area on the page, we run a series of tests to find out what’s the most effective area to put that slot. And Polar is really a delivery mechanism as well. You put in five different thumbnails and headlines, and try maybe five different areas, it will run to find the most effective one. This way we try to combine the best creative process with the best space on the page.”</p> <h2>Getting creative with it</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “Ok. I often realize that when we have these holistic discussions it’s not immediately apparent what needs to be done. We see research saying we should be more creative in advertising - do you think this will gain traction?”</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-alison-ashworth.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Ashworth, Strategy Partner for Carat, speaks at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention.

How do you build emotion around brands? I don’t know if this has really changed. I think in the last five years you’ve seen the world of digital and programmatic emerge. It’s all become automated. And it scared a lot of creative people. They are used to big expensive formats, they are used to storytelling. We live in an exciting and scary time. We’re not embracing the opportunity for sequential storytelling through programmatic. I think the narrative at the moment is quite fearful. That’s why we are all having this debate again.”</p> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “Is it the fear of the CMO who knows he’s about to get fired because he can’t prove ROI?”</p> <p><strong>Alison</strong>: “Is that a new fear? I think it’s just easier to gather short-term metrics and therefore short-term metrics rise to the top. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. But there’s plenty of conversation around that and organisations are evolving.”</p> <h2>Site's speed delivers knock on effect</h2> <p><strong>Dilip</strong>: “The industry is indeed evolving. And will continue to. Data is going to be more under control and publishers and advertising can think about how they can work more closely together.”</p> <p><strong>Ian</strong>: “I think one of the things that’s interesting here is the speed of your publisher’s site. Each additional entry into the chain slows that done by <em>x</em>. And that has such a knock-on effect on the user. Latency affects everything. It affects your storytelling right down to that engagement and trust. I think there’s an element of fear for a reader when they land on a page and something is going on - they see words and pictures but the site hasn’t loaded yet in its entirety. New adtech needs to fall in line with the rules you have set to create a consistent experience across your site for all readers. We usually adopt a vendor-in-vendor-out policy, so we keep the baseline speed of the site consistent.”</p> <h2>What does the reader want?</h2> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-aop-lolly-mason.jpg\" alt=\"Lolly Mason, VP Media Partnerships EMEA at Celtra, speaks at 2017 AOP Digital Publishing Convention.

Innovation comes from understanding what the reader actually wants when they show up on the page. And then try to take them on another journey than the one that has been set out.”</p> <p><span><strong>Alasdair</strong>: “I think advertising and content can work in harmony.

The venue for this media-themed meetup included a stage and bar suited for an intimate concert, making it a great place for an evening full of talks, Q&amp;A, networking, drinks and Dutch finger-food.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our Head of Bibblio Labs, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbertvanderpluijm/\" target=\"_blank\">Robbert van der Pluijm</a>, had the opportunity to speak about the scale challenge we're solving and share the first findings of our venture into deep learning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s a transcript of his talk, <em>Scaling a recommendation service - a threefold story:</em><br><br></p> <hr> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>A threefold story</h2> <p>\"Hello, I'm Robbert van der Pluijm. Thank you for having me. I want to start off on a personal note: I went through my Twitter feed today and discovered <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881117735687\" target=\"_blank\">an interesting study</a>&nbsp;published by SAGE Journals recently. The study showed that people who consumed a low dose of alcohol had significantly better observer-ratings for their second language, specifically better pronunciation, compared with those who did not consume alcohol. The researchers called the phenomenon 'Dutch courage'. Let's embrace it tonight with a couple of beers.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdamTitleslide.jpg\" alt=\"Bibblio Labs at RecSys Amsterdam\"></figure> <p>\"My talk is standing in between you and those beers, so tonight's menu will be snappy. First I'll share a bit about Bibblio. Then I'll tell you about what we've worked on, what we're doing right now and what we want to solve in the nearby future. So, a threefold story.</p> <h2>The villain</h2> <p>\"I have a man crush on Christoph Waltz, so kicking off with a quote of his seemed like a good idea: \"Well, you need the villain. If you don't have a villain, the good guy can stay home.\" In our case the villain being the content recommendations networks everyone loves to hate. For example, this morning, I pulled this Revcontent module [below] from <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/world/\" target=\"_blank\">The Atlantic</a>. It figured out I was in The Netherlands, but other than that it offered a horrible experience. These recommendations try to entice the reader to click on irrelevant suggestions to send them to clickbait sites.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam3.jpg\" alt=\"RecSysAmsterdam3\"></figure> <p>\"We at Bibblio want to offer a totally different kind of experience. Our recommendation service helps publishers build genuine audience engagement by displaying relevant suggestions back to their own content.</p> <h2>The good guy</h2> <p>\"A little bit about how our service works. Our customers, seen here: online publishers, libraries and course platforms, push their content to our API platform. Their content gets enriched and the customer requests the recommendations from an API endpoint.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam4.jpg\" alt=\"Bibblio's system in a nutshell\"></figure> <p>“Publishers can retrieve recommendations for each of our algorithms independently. Our reason for adopting this modular format is to restore transparency and control to our clients, both important values for Bibblio. Publishers use our pre-built widgets or build their own. The customisable, pre-built module brings us tracking data. When they have their own widget in place they can ping us the user interaction data so our machine can learn.</p> <h2>Rethinking popularity</h2> <p>\"Time for the first part of the threefold story. Something we've worked on already: building a local popularity recommender.</p> <p>\"The local popularity recommender draws upon our first algorithm we created that is intended to leverage interaction data. Before this, we were only able to draw upon document content, so we’re pretty excited. Thankfully, it turned out to be quite straightforward to implement, so we were able to receive quick feedback from our clients and their end-users.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam9.jpg\" alt=\"Why did we build a local popularity recommender\"></figure> <p>\"Building the local popularity recommender was a stab at creating a better way to show popular content to end-users. Ubiquitous modules like 'Most popular' are often static and offer content which is largely irrelevant for the individual end-user at that time. We wanted to rethink popularity for content websites.</p> <p>\"The problem with interaction data is that you have to deal with a learning period where early trends can be misleading. The worst thing you can do is to determine popularity and then not leave room to adapt. You should give yourself the chance to explore the possibility that other — old and new — items have a higher click rate. That insight led us to investigate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit\" target=\"_blank\">multi-armed bandit </a>algorithms.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam10.jpg\" alt=\"Using multi-armed bandit algorithms\"></figure> <p>\"With a multi-armed bandit - who we call Harry by the way - each ‘arm’ could be any one of the content items from the entire corpus we’re recommending from. This means that initial recommendations using this technique will appear random and this may degrade the quality of the end-user experience. So here comes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf\" target=\"_blank\">TF-IDF</a> to help us out. We use TF-IDF scores to limit the pool of ‘arms’: the set of arms from which the algorithm can select its action in each learning instant is restricted to the top performing recommendations that were obtained using the TF-IDF algorithm.</p> <p>\"Periodically we update our bandit algorithm using fresh interaction data that has become available since the last learning phase. As the experiment progresses, we learn more and more about the relative payoffs, and so do a better job in choosing good recommendations. We always incorporate arms that explore new items which come into the catalogue and as audience behaviour changes.</p> <h2>Streaming to the rescue</h2> <p>\"Time for the second part of the threefold story. This includes something we are working on putting into production right now: a streaming architecture.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam11.jpg\" alt=\"Challenges of scale and catalogue updating\"></figure> <p>\"First the challenges we are aiming to solve with this. With TF-IDF vectorisation you have the complexity challenge of performing pairwise comparisons of different embeddings for the content items in your catalogue. We have quite a tight on-boarding pipeline for our clients, and we basically throttle that pipeline because we have to wait for a few hours for these pairwise comparisons to be completed. That’s not viable for some of our clients.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam12.jpg\" alt=\"The scale challenge\"></figure> <p>\"This is connected to the second challenge, which we call the update challenge. Some of our clients, for example <a href=\"http://theday.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Day</a>, who provide an online news service for schools, publish new articles on a daily basis. They want recommendations for these ‘fresh’ content items as quickly as possible. With our pre-streaming architecture we need to wait an hour or so before the recommendations for the freshly ingested items are available.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam13.jpg\" alt=\"The challenge of catalogue updating\"></figure> <p>“We also have other types of clients, for example the <a href=\"http://deslibris.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Electronic Library</a> [desLibris] who are not ingesting books on an hourly or even daily basis. In this case, we can afford to do a full or bulk index of the entire corpus overnight or when a reasonable number of content items have been accumulated in our system.</p> <p>\"This is our streaming architecture<span>&nbsp;[below]</span>. We have fresh items coming in, which get ingested and enriched. We’ve plugged in our ingestion into Watson Natural Language Understanding to produce metadata. We also present it as an option for clients to open for viewing by the user. Those items are then queued in order to be indexed into Redis. We have a butler handler process that determines which streaming mode to activate, and this draws upon optimisation heuristics. The heuristics are based on the size of the corpus, the number of new items, the nature of the client among other things. This determines whether we should perform a bulk index, which includes an all-against-all comparison and introduces quadratic complexity, or go down the streaming route.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam15.jpg\" alt=\"Our Streaming Architecture\"></figure> <p>“We can perform a full vectorisation, meaning we recompute all the TF-IDF vectors and the dictionary. Otherwise, we have the option of performing partial vectorisation. We basically still do the full vectorisation, but we load the saved dictionary back in. And as I mentioned before, in both streaming cases we perform a partial distance matrix computation. We finally push all the recommendations into Redis.</p> <h2>Taking a leap into the unknown</h2> <p>&nbsp;\"And finally, time for the third part of the threefold story. I'd like to share a bit about our recently-started venture into deep learning.&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Last August, Bibblio's CEO Mads Holmen and Lead Data Scientist Dr. Mahbub Gani made their way to Como, Italy, to attend the annual <a href=\"https://recsys.acm.org/recsys17/\" target=\"_blank\">ACM Recommender Systems conference</a>. They picked up some interesting research on deep learning. Worth noting is that YouTube's recommendations have been driven by deep learning since last year. It's still very much an area to explore, and not proven in many instances for recommenders yet.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam17.jpg\" alt=\"Research in the recommendation systems community\"></figure> <p>\"In this slide [below] we have listed the potential of deep learning over older machine learning. Embracing deep learning could enable us to craft a holistic feature-set that reduces manual intervention. This approach could allow Bibblio to continuously improve our results as we scale further, whereas the performance gains of for example collaborative filtering approaches frequently tail off after initial training.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam18.jpg\" alt=\"From machine learning to deep learning\"></figure> <p>\"Getting into deep learning isn't easy. It requires a vast amount of data, a robust data pipeline for handling both signals from content and readers, immense computing power and clear values defined for the system to optimise for. Using Bibblio’s existing data pipelines, nimble streaming architecture and <a href=\"http://www.bibblio.org/about\" target=\"_blank\">ethics and design principles,</a> we hope to be able to overcome these barriers.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/RecSysAmsterdam19.jpg\" alt=\"Examples of signals in deep learning\"></figure> <p>\"We've decided to launch a spike into this space using the Google Cloud Platform and TensorFlow. Here [above] you see a list of signals we can start to work with. The focus of our system will be to create a better web for end-users and publishers. This means our deep learning based recommender system should maximise for user satisfaction and retention while reaching a certain level of revenue and content coverage/diversity. We'll work closely with our clients and end-users to develop more concrete ideas.</p> <p>\"This leap into deep learning is an exciting, novel and risky endeavour. The work is on the way. Shall we agree I come back in a couple of months and talk about the results?\"</p> <br><br> <p>&nbsp;</p> <hr> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>Bibblio solves the problems of audience retention and engagement by showing each user the best of your own content.</span></p>",

    "post_content": "<p>How digital news outlet Republic got to 24,000 paying subscribers</p> <!--more--> <p>In November of last year I discovered the article ‘<a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/why-should-your-stories-be-free-c22831f56bf0\" target=\"_blank\">Why Should Your Stories Be Free?</a>’, written by publisher turned editor-in-chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kashulinsky\" target=\"_blank\">Maxim Kashulinsky</a>&nbsp;<span>(the guy sat at his laptop, above)<span>.</span></span> He argued for the introduction of a paywall for his independent digital news outlet, <a href=\"https://republic.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Republic</a>. We featured this story in our publication,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph\" target=\"_blank\">The Graph</a>.</p> <p>We are delighted to now share more on how Maxim and his team have grown Republic’s subscriber base to 24,000, each paying up to 60 USD per year. Below you’ll find the interview I had with Maxim, distilling the five ways the news outlet has accomplished this feat.</p> <h2>1. Bring less news and more stories</h2> <p><em>Robbert</em>: “We chatted back in November 2016, and since then you’ve become editor-in-chief of Republic. What’s been on your mind?\"</p> <p><em>Maxim</em>: “As the new editor-in-chief, I started thinking where we should go in 2017-18. What should we do with the publication? I was sure we should remain a subscription platform, because we saw that readers were willing to pay for meaningful information. We’ve been putting our political, business and economic content behind a paywall since 2014. Subscriptions helped us to be cash flow positive since the end of that year.</p> <p>“There were three types of stories on our website: news articles, opinion pieces from outside contributors and features written by our reporters. The idea was to strengthen all three.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-left\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-republic-offices.jpg\" alt=\"Republic's offices\" title=\"Republic's offices\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"> <figcaption>Republic's offices. Credit: Arseny Neskhodimov</figcaption> </figure> <p>“Take news articles. Until recently we mainly curated news stories coming from news agencies and other newspapers, editing them only for readability. This type of news aggregation was good – it’s a product. You should also keep in mind that websites publishing uncensored news are scarce in Russia. But I started to think that we needed to do more to retain and grow our subscriber base. That’s why we are now bringing more added value into our news coverage: there is no need to report all important “news of the day” anymore, as people get news from Facebook or Twitter anyway. We’d write a news article only when we have something to add. It correlates with what our subscribers say. Through our <a href=\"https://telegram.me/RepublicMag\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram</a>, Slack and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/republic.ru\" target=\"_blank\">other</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Republic_Mag\" target=\"_blank\">channels</a> we communicate directly to them and we found that they’re really looking for our stories, such as opinion pieces, editorial commentaries and investigative journalism.”</p> <h2>2. Newsletters are key</h2> <p><em>Robbert</em>: “How have you been communicating these changes to your audience?\"</p> <p><em>Maxim</em>: \"We have a free newsletter we send to people every day at 9am. The workday in Moscow starts a bit later in comparison to the States, for example, so most people get it during their commute or at breakfast time. Our newsletter consists of three parts: the curated news ‘to get your day started’, the in-depth Republic stories, and direct links to other news websites. Most of those latter links lead to English-language articles.</p> <p>“The newsletter excerpts of our in-depth stories lead to content behind a paywall, which makes the newsletter part of our funnel. When you subscribe to this free newsletter, we send you an email with a discount in a week or so.</p> <p>“Interestingly, people who receive the free newsletter interact with the news articles to other sites the most. I think this is because it’s full of surprises - we like to link to articles discussing psychological concepts, business strategies or even physics. An article on the solar eclipse in America drove a lot of interest.</p> <p>“Last July we also launched a newsletter that we send exclusively to our subscribers. Every newsletter features a short column written by one of our journalists or guest authors. In this column, they discuss a topic they care about. They always share three links to external articles.”</p> <h2>3. Give people great deals</h2> <p><em>Robbert</em>: “When people show interest in a story behind your paywall, how do you improve conversion on your subscription page?\"</p> <p><em>Maxim</em>: “Since June we’ve been using bespoke landing pages on which you can subscribe to Republic. We use this for sponsorship deals, where a blogger, for instance, can use a specific link to get his or her readers a discount for a Republic subscription.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-republic-metrics.jpg\" alt=\"Republic's metrics\" width=\"780\" height=\"338\"> <figcaption>One of Republic's main metrics: Subscribers. Bars upwards are new subscribers, bars downwards are expirations. The red line is the total.</figcaption> </figure> <p>“From December last year, we gained 4,000 extra subscribers. I contribute some of this growth to a smart marketing campaign in July in which we tied the discount rate to the temperature in Moscow. The weather was terrible in the first summer month, so we started our ‘Let’s make it hotter’ campaign. During several weeks the size of discount was set automatically every hour and equaled the temperature outside our office multiplied by two. E.g. 19 degrees Celsius meant 38% off the price of the subscription. It was fun, I saw people waiting for peak temperatures to purchase the subscription.”</p> <h2>4. Run quality sponsored content for your subscribers</h2> <p><em>Robbert</em>: “How much of the revenue does <a href=\"https://republic.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Republic</a> get from subscriptions? And where does the rest come from?\"</p> <p><em>Maxim</em>: “We earn more than 60% of our total revenue through subscriptions. We still sell banners, but our traffic numbers aren’t big enough to make an impact. We don’t really care about page views as such – we’re interested in retention.</p> <p>“The biggest traffic source to our website is ‘direct’, with our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/republic.ru\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Republic_Mag\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> accounts following behind that. We ran a video project on Facebook last year and we learned that what happens on Facebook stays on Facebook. Our audience on Facebook grew almost tenfold, but there was no uplift in subscribers. So, we cancelled the project. We do have a good experience with running targeted ads on Facebook with subscription deals though.</p> <p>“What works well for us is sponsored ‘partner articles’ written by freelance journalists on our behalf. We recently did an article with Korean Air. We work with an author who lives in South Korea and he wrote an interesting post about unexpected places there. My favorite part of that story was about the rising craft beer scene. The story is written like any other story on Republic, but we clearly mention it’s sponsored. We are transparent about all <a href=\"https://republic.ru/advertise\" target=\"_blank\">advertising rules</a> on our website to both subscriber and advertiser.”</p> <h2>5. Be a place of intelligence&nbsp;</h2> <p><em>Robbert</em>: “What are the other things you want to work on? Where do you see <a href=\"https://republic.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Republic</a> going?\"</p> <p><em>Maxim</em>: “I want <a href=\"https://republic.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Republic</a> to become the place people come to for great stories and wonderful ideas. After all, what do people get from professional media? News, stories, ideas or help. We can’t compete with bigger news organizations in reporting news. Helping readers to buy a new car, raise a child or cure a headache isn’t our aim either; at least we don’t want to give practical advice. We give our readers information which they would share with friends at the dinner, in the bar, at a conference room. No jokes, no memes, no funny photos but something meaningful, something which would probably change their lives or attitudes. It could be <a href=\"https://republic.ru/posts/85167\">a scary story</a> about a secret FSB jail where alleged terrorists are tortured before being brought to official trial or <a href=\"https://republic.ru/posts/86525\">a story</a> about a flamboyant and talented TV producer who has created a great TV Channel from scratch. It could be a new way to treat cancer, or how to deal with economic inequality, or a theory which explains the failure of one of the biggest Russian banks. I want to raise the bar of discussion on <a href=\"https://republic.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">Republic</a> and make it the place where the best minds share their views on politics, economics and life.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-right\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-republic-mediamakers.jpg\" alt=\"Maxim at MediaMakers conference in Moscow, with former Bild publisher, Kai Diekmann\" title=\"Maxim at MediaMakers conference in Moscow, with former Bild publisher, Kai Diekmann\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\"> <figcaption>Maxim (right) at MediaMakers conference in Moscow, with former Bild publisher, Kai Diekmann</figcaption> </figure> <p>“We only hire people who have experience at one of the quality publications in Russia and are in favor of experimenting. One of the things I want us to work on is our comment section, which is only open to subscribers. I usually like the level of discussions going on and our subscribers even add to or correct stories written by our authors, which is great.</p> <p>“I also want to share more insights with other subscription platforms in Europe and beyond. And we learn a lot from other publications. Last year, for instance, we organized the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mediamakers.ru/\" target=\"_blank\">MediaMakers</a>&nbsp;conference, to which we brought top speakers like publishers of Bild and De Correspondent, as well as editors from Quartz and Buzzfeed.”</p>",

Everyone should have access to this sort of technology without having to alienate users or ruin their experience with low quality ads inside Taboola or Outbrain modules.</p> <p>We built and launched an API at the start of this year that allows anyone to have smart recommendations on their site. Then, we started to think about ways we could make it even easier for lots of people to use Bibblio: becoming a member of the WordPress community seemed like the obvious answer - people kept asking us whether we had a plugin!</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-wp-bibblio-denver.jpg\" title=\"Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen (right) at WordCamp, Denver\" alt=\"Bibblio CEO Mads Holmen (right) at WordCamp, Denver\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">WordPress is an incredible tool, powering more than 25% of the world’s websites and creating a real sense of ownership and evangelism among its users. We think it’s a great place for a company trying to make the web a better place to be. We experienced the unique WordPress ethos firsthand at WordCamp in Denver and Brighton, and it’s an incredibly open, helpful and fun environment to work in. People care.</p> <p>So we’re launching <em>Related Posts by Bibblio</em>, a plugin which will allow anyone on WordPress to get all the power of <a href=\"http://www.bibblio.org\" target=\"_blank\">Bibblio’s recommendation engine</a> onto their WordPress site in a few minutes. It’s the latest recommendation technology, delivered via API so it won’t blow up your server or slow down your site. In keeping with the WordPress spirit there is an entry plan that’s free, forever. Our technology, including all module designs and support, is for everyone, not just premium customers. We cater for blogs with a hundred posts and premium publishers with millions of views.</p> <p>Going forward our mission on WordPress is to help connect the community through content: allowing sites to share audiences and help users find the best content, maybe even on other WordPress sites. YouTubers, for example, learned a while back that rather than competing for audiences with similar interests, they share them. When the user wins, the community wins.</p> <p>The first step is helping WordPress sites connect their own users to their best content, and that’s what we’ve done by launching <em>Related Posts by Bibblio</em>. We’re confident that it will mean a better experience for users and a hassle free way to increase revenue for sites.</p> <p>As part of our launch we’re giving the first ten early-adopters the chance to get Bibblio for the princely sum of <strong>nothing for one year!</strong> Then there's a <strong>30% discount forever</strong>. The next twenty will get the 30% discount as well. First come, first served.</p> <p>Check it out and let us know what you think!</p>",

    "post_content": "<p>How this dedicated magazine is leveraging their archive and social following to grow their business</p> <!--more--> <p>Bringing fans “the latest and greatest” for over 40 years, the world’s most widely read drum magazine has flipped the way they sell subscriptions, and they’re better for it.</p> <p>At the first edition of <a href=\"https://2017-denver.journalist.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp for Publishers</a> earlier this year, we met Peter Ericson, founder of WordPress agency <a href=\"https://zeen101.com/\">ZEEN101</a>. He connected us with Miguel Monroy at the US magazine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.moderndrummer.com/\">Modern Drummer</a>, who has been working with Peter on their site.</p> <h2>Miguel’s mission</h2> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-miguel-monroy.jpg\" alt=\"Miguel Monroy\" title=\"Miguel Monroy\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">Miguel is Business and Content Development Lead at Modern Drummer, and he tells me at least half of his job is coming up with new ways to monetize products and services outside of their traditional print magazine:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“We’ve had the old-school hard copy magazine for 40 years. But it’s 2017 now, and people want to be able to experience content in an entirely new way. That’s part of the reason we partnered with ZEEN101.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>When Miguel joined the magazine in April 2015, he quickly saw he needed to make sure revenue wasn't coming from just one source. Print advertisers were starting to pull out and he had to come up with other ways to generate revenue. Miguel's most important job is to make sure they don’t put all their eggs in one basket.</p> <h2>All the baskets</h2> <p>Currently, Modern Drummer runs ads and sponsored content on their website, through apps and on their social channels. Modern Drummer has over 430k people following <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ModernDrummer/\">their Facebook page</a>. Their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/modern_drummer/\">Instagram account</a> has 149k followers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/modern_drummer\">Twitter </a>has gathered 75K followers. Miguel talks about some new advertising options they have set up through these channels:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“Our advertisers can now send us an image or a video, and I’ll promote it through our advertising account on Facebook. So rather than a brand using their own channel, they can now partner with a trusted party in the industry.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Recently, many publishers have been investing heavily in video and some even chose to go <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-pivoting-video-5-charts/\">all-in</a>, laying off writers in the process. Miguel wouldn’t want to pivot to video entirely but does agree that video content is a big deal and people want to experience it more:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“Firstly, we see an opportunity for advertising. We now offer a new ‘mini-documentary’ option. Advertisers pay a lump sum and in return I’ll come and shoot a video on their company or brand. The video gets shared with our social media followers.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-modern-drummer-educational.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Drummer's educational articles\" title=\"Modern Drummer's educational articles\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\"> <blockquote class=\"clearfix\"> <p><i>“Video also has a great impact on our digital product - our online magazine. For example, when we have an educational article - let’s say a drum lesson - I can now have the text, the sheet music and the video of the drummer playing it, all in one article. My readers can experience it in every single way.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>A true experience</h2> <p>Offering that experience to absolutely anyone who loves drumming and drummers has been a life changer for the magazine. Modern Drummer has introduced a metered version of a paywall last February, whereas before they had a 'full' one. Since then, they have seen their monthly organic traffic to the website grow about 20%:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“Without a doubt, the best decision we ever made was to go to a metered paywall setting. Everyone can read three articles per month for free. What this also means is that every single article can be indexed by Google. Every feature, education piece, articles on the latest gear and technology, reviews and so on. Every article can be shared with people's friends, and their friends can share it with theirs and so on... We get the social organic ripple effect.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>The metered paywall, referred to by Miguel as the <a href=\"https://zeen101.com/for-developers/leakypaywall/\">Leaky Paywall solution</a>, has totally changed the way Modern Drummer sells subscriptions and it’s very much to his liking:</p> <img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-modern-drummer-shoot.jpg\" title=\"Modern Drummer photoshoot\" alt=\"Modern Drummer photoshoot\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\"> <blockquote> <p><i>“It makes me so happy that I can sell subscriptions by having people experience great content. I don’t have to tell them “I promise we’re great”, but rather point them at incredible articles. And after they check out two more articles, they discover the option to subscribe for $5 per month themselves.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>For this to work, it’s important to not put anything between the reader and the content. Miguel tells me that before they switched to the paywall, Modern Drummer had an ad that would pop up and cover your entire screen. It made him furious:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“I hated it the second I started working for the Modern Drummer. So I laid down the gauntlet and said “when we launch this paywall, that has to go”.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>And it did go. Choosing the metered paywall approach changed their relationship with ads altogether:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“We found that the organic subscriptions we were getting each month, naturally by people discovering our content, out-perform our ‘subscribe now!’ ads. So we changed our strategy to focus on growing our base of social followers.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Miguel mentions that growing your fan base on social is hard, especially when you don’t want to pay money. Fortunately, Modern Drummer nowadays gets about 75% of their follower growth organically, due to people enjoying their content and sharing it with their friends. Miguel tells me a small percentage is done by paying to target people in their industry.</p> <p>Another important driver to get people to interact with content is Modern Drummer’s newsletter. Currently, they have around 80k people signed up. The newsletter gets sent out once a month with ‘all you need to know articles’ about drum shells, cymbals, heads - “basically things every drummer can benefit from”.</p> <h2>Making it work</h2> <p>In order to up the chances of people coming across three articles which will persuade them to sign up, Modern Drummer invests greatly in utilising the huge archive of content created over the last four decades:</p> <p><i>“We have a person on staff and part of what he does is going through the very old articles. He’s making sure each article from every issue is available individually and responsive on our website and apps. It’s a huge amount of work, but every time we publish an old or new article, they can be indexed by Google and become searchable.</i></p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-modern-drummer-homepages.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Drummer homepages\" title=\"Modern Drummer homepages\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\">Each article remains connected to an issue, with its own unique aesthetic design, Miguel tells me as we're looking at the website:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“When you go to the site now you see these red accent colors and things like that. When you go to our archive and select another issue, the website changes. Every single issue is unique, in and of itself. Details like that make it bad-ass.”</i></p> </blockquote> <p>Part of what makes working with issues, old and new, so rewarding is the <i>evergreen </i>nature of Modern Drummer’s content. Many pieces will be just as relevant today as it was to people many years ago. People tend to form big attachments to people they write about. This inspired Miguel to start working on so called ‘artists packs’:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“You may have heard about the band Rush. We’ve been writing articles on their drummer for almost the full 40 years. So we got nine cover stories and lots of different things. We put all of it together and you can download it to your iPad or wherever you want. So all these articles are available for anyone who’s super passionate about that drummer and band. That’s the beautiful thing about what we’re doing.\"&nbsp;</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>Beautiful things take time</h2> <p>Working hard on both the business and content side, I ask Miguel which is the most challenging when taking the business forward:</p> <blockquote> <p><i>“It's realizing that switching to a new business model doesn’t get you major results instantly. It builds slowly over time. The challenge for us is to be patient and focus on that long term goal. We want to build a subscriber base out of dedicated, loyal people. I don’t want fly-by-night people who subscribe for one month and are gone the next.</i></p> <p><i>“I’m happy to say we’re getting to the point where we don’t have to rely on print advertising, online advertising or just subscribers - &nbsp;it’s several different baskets that are starting to add up.\"</i></p> </blockquote> <h2>Print surprise</h2> <p>Miguel makes sure that before we end our conversation I take note of what has been the most surprising realization over the last couple of months - print is far from dead for Modern Drummer:</p> <img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-modern-drummer-printed.jpg\" title=\"Modern Drummer print covers\" alt=\"Modern Drummer print covers\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\"> <blockquote> <p><i>“With the introduction of our digital option we were expecting our print options to die down. But it has not actually been the case. Our print subscriptions have been increasing since we started the digital option. This is because people are smart, and they can do the math. They can either pay $60 a year for the digital option or subscribe to the monthly print magazine for 30 bucks. And you can add the online archive to the print magazine for $120 a year. Print is an important part of our future and the digital offering supports it even more.\"</i><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></p> </blockquote> <h2><span>Final thoughts</span></h2> <p><span>When you explore the web, you can't escape the feeling that shallow sensationalism has become the norm for much of our digital ecosystem. </span></p> <p><span>Great publishers like the Modern Drummer show that content quality and overall user experience not only still matters, but could turn out to be the key in shaping a sustainable media business. There's no doubt in my mind that there'll always be a place for publishers nailing a vertical by putting their readership first. This includes doing \"bad-ass things\", of course.</span></p>",

    "post_date": "26-Sep-2017 10:19:48",
    "post_content": "<p>David Attenborough or Doctor Phil?</p> <!--more--> <p>That was the question I posed at the end of <a href=\"http://www.bibblio.org/blog/a-crisis-of-attention\">A Crisis of Attention – Part I</a>. In that post I explored the ways in which the war for our attention has escalated in the internet age, and the stakes are high – increasing triviality, or continued progress. This has caused serious problems for quality media. The loss of gatekeepers, the compounding effect of competition for attention and the feedback loop from digital products has made it easier to capture and hold our attention.</p> <p>An ugly suspicion seems to have been confirmed: the easiest route to grabbing our attention is content that appeals to our Freudian selves and to extremes. With advertising as the dominant funding model for the internet, shallow sensationalism has become the norm for much of our digital ecosystem. “Whatever gets punters clicking” seems to be Facebook’s operating mantra (although they admittedly have been great at moving fast and breaking a lot of things).</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-young-east-asian-man-tablet.jpg\" alt=\"Appealing to our better selves\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\">I don’t think that it has to be this way though. The digital world can be designed to appeal to our best selves too. In fact, things may slowly be changing already; people are rapidly getting wise to the ways they’re being manipulated and new business models and products are appearing across the web. A few years ago, all articles seemed to suddenly have a click-bait headline and land you on a slide show that loaded 20 pages full of ads – but the world is moving on already. Under pressure from both the media and consumers, both Google and Facebook have <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2016/08/04/facebook-officially-declared-war-clickbait/#.tnw_BFIslLnq\">declared</a> that they are now punishing these types of titles and pages with an ad overload. Fake news is already seeing efforts to punish it in the same way.</p> <p>In this post, I want to discuss the increasing evidence that content quality and putting users first not only still matters, but could be the dominant force shaping the future of media and publishing.</p> <p>Last month, member-funded journalism platform <a href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/\">The Correspondent</a> held interviews with their paying subscribers on why they support the platform. The team at The Correspondent shared their research materials and summed up the results <a href=\"https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/2017/4/3/you-get-the-feeling-they-really-looked-into-it\">in 13 main points</a>. It’s enticing reading.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-de-correspondent.jpg\" alt=\"De Correspondent\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">What stood out for me is that the people who pay for the platform value the depth of content and the user-friendly experience. The Correspondent “doesn’t bring you the weather (surface events) but the climate (the deeper forces at work)”. There are no hot takes or quick reactions to the news, just deeply researched articles that explain the relevant context. And the Correspondent aren’t alone – <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/offering-a-daily-perspective-to-members-c2061dfe235e\">other organisations</a> are treading the same path with success.</p> <p>The Correspondent’s subscribers, or <em>members</em> as they prefer to call them, also appreciate the visual and interface design which they describe as calm, simple and with <a href=\"https://membershippuzzle.org/articles-overview/2017/4/3/you-get-the-feeling-they-really-looked-into-it\">a human touch</a>: “The fact that [our platform] isn't always grabbing for your attention is noticed and deeply appreciated.” And that, really, is the simple truth that will shape the future of media – users have had enough of being treated as if they don’t matter. They’re increasingly getting fed up with being the product, with being commodified and sold to advertisers by the millions.</p> <p>The Correspondent is ad-free and their business, which will be expanding to the USA soon, is funded solely by about 60,000 members. However, most media platforms still rely on advertising for a significant portion of their revenues. Whether you have a site with a broad, transient audience or a niche, dedicated readership, brands and other advertisers are interested in buying their attention.</p> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"> <h5>U.S. Ad Revenues (USD billions)</h5> <table class=\"editorial-table\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\"> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">2015</th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">2016</th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Growth</th> <th style=\"text-align: center;\">Share of Growth</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class=\"row-odd\"> <th style=\"text-align: left;\">Google</th> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$31.3</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$37.6</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$6.3</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">49%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row-even\"> <th style=\"text-align: left;\">Facebook</th> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$8.9</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$14.1</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$5.1</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row-odd\"> <th style=\"text-align: left;\">Everyone else</th> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$19.4</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$20.8</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$1.4</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">11%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row-even\"> <th style=\"text-align: left;\">PWC/IAB</th> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$59.6</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$72.5</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">$12.9</td> <td style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <figcaption class=\"table-source\">Source: IAB/PWC</figcaption> </figure> <p>There’s no reason to believe that this is going to end any time soon. The digital advertising industry is growing, and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/\">the global amount spent</a> is expected to hit $229.25bn this year and grow towards $335.5bn by 2020. This sounds like good news for a lot of media sites trying to pay the bills. The bad news is that nearly all that growth – <a href=\"https://digiday.com/hot-topic/duopoly/\">around 90%</a> - is going to the duopoly: Google and Facebook.</p> <p>Publishers having to scrap over the remaining 10 percent of that growth have created many challenges for the industry. As Dotdash’s CEO Neil Vogel said <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/instant-articles-amp-make-no-economic-sense-digiday-town-hall-dotdash-ceo-neil-vogel/\">in conversation with Digiday</a>: “The rules of the internet are clearly made by a few parties that are interested in their own success, not ours.” He believes Google’s ad filter and Facebook’s new guidelines will <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/google-reveals-sites-failing-ads-including-forbes-la-times/\">benefit premium publishers</a>. “But there is tremendous risk in Google and Facebook dictating the internet.” Roger McNamee, an early investor in both Google and Facebook agrees and published the confessional <a href=\"http://amp.usatoday.com/story/543755001/\">‘I invested early in Google and Facebook and regret it. I helped create a monster.’</a></p> <p>Some publishers are trying to take a stand against the dominance of the duopoly and are <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/future-businesses-stake-european-publishers-exploring-alternatives-duopoly/\">exploring alternatives</a>, such as using independent ad tech providers, putting traditional rivalries aside to form their own&nbsp;programmatic ad sales networks or offering <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/eye-duopoly-german-broadcasters-unite-create-unified-consumer-login/\">unified consumer logins</a>.</p> <p>What I get most excited about, however, is success stories based on making ads non-intrusive and helping the publishers deliver a better experience. This is fundamentally the same story as The Correspondent – the rewards of treating users as real people again. Some publishers, such as the female-focused <a href=\"https://www.littlethings.com/\">LittleThings</a>, are now taking a “less is more” approach when it comes to placing ads across their sites. Stripping out irritating ad formats and limiting the number of ads forced on visitors can actually result in more engaged consumers and ultimately <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-publishers-try-reducing-ads-to-boost-revenue-1499940061\">increased ad revenue</a>. Another initiative, called the <a href=\"https://mondaynote.com/the-news-quality-scoring-project-surfacing-great-journalism-from-the-web-48401ded8b53\">News Quality Scoring Project</a> (NQS), is focused on rewarding quality journalism on the web at scale by making sure all pages aren’t counted equally.</p> <div class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\"> <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed hs-responsive-embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"width: 300px;\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/LFhOHRNSdzI\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-service=\"youtube\"></iframe></div> <div class=\"table-source\" style=\"text-align: center;\">One minute video explaining the project</div> </div> <p>NQS’s goal is to develop a system able to automatically analyse different types of content, from generic news coverage to an in-depth investigative piece, whatever the format, and assign them a value. NQS is based on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhOHRNSdzI\">capture and analysis of about 50 signals</a> that convey the notion of quality. Higher-value pieces should carry a higher advertising value, and/or be part of premium subscription packages.</p> <p>Time will tell whether the publisher alliances will hold and the other progressive initiatives in advertising take off. In a digital media world steered by big tech companies, a lot is still unclear. One thing that it crystal clear to me though is that there is a growing demand for quality content and better user experiences – perfectly exemplified by the Net Quality Scoring Project and the approach taken by LittleThings in the ad-driven world. Businesses like The Correspondent also show there’s an increasing willingness from consumers to put their credit card where their mouth is. Publishers can’t afford to underestimate what this means for their newsrooms, online offerings and business models. To flourish in the long run, they will need to pivot to user-driven products like subscription or double down on progressive advertising. And not tomorrow - now. Here’s why:</p> <h2>Past performance is no guarantee of future results</h2> <p>Since November 2016, Google and Facebook have driven around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.parse.ly/post/5194/referral-traffic/\">80 percent</a> of all identifiable external traffic&nbsp;to digital publishers. According to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/echobox/saturday-is-facebook-day-498e4809e6ea\">Social Media Index</a>, over 12% of the total traffic to news publishers last year came from Facebook.&nbsp;For much of the summer it was around 16%. These are the sorts of numbers which it could be tempting to base a business strategy on.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-ev-williams.jpg\" alt=\"Ev Williams. Credit: Flickr/Christopher P. Michel\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\">Historically, the cheapest way to earn a cent from this situation has been to create huge amounts of sensationalist content with clickbait titles, push it on social and watch the two billion active Facebook users hit programmatic ads crammed onto your pages. And despite the duopoly and the brand damage from a shoddy user experience, you might earn a lot of those cents. People click, so there must be a genuine demand, right? Sort of: as the founder of Medium, Ev Williams, said in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/10/twitter-ev-williams-medium-content-fast-food\">an interview</a> with The Guardian: “We’re still stuck in some very naive thinking, with the idea that people consuming media means that’s what they want – it’s like, well, we put junk food in front of them and they ate that, so that must be what they want.”</p> <p>I believe audiences are already having a change of heart as they become more aware. Ev’s analogy with junk food is spot on. Take McDonalds, for example. In the nineties, you would have expected them to grow and grow, but now we’re in 2017, and earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-results-idUSKBN1571P6\">a report</a> came out that traffic at their US restaurants, the most profitable market, has fallen more than 10 percent over the last four years. Those numbers are hard to ignore.</p> <p>It’s equally hard to miss the movement for ‘a better web’. As well as Ev Williams, there are many others now taking a stand. Perhaps the best known is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tristanharris\">Tristan Harris</a>, former Google design ethicist and co-founder of Time Well Spent. He recently did a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_the_manipulative_tricks_tech_companies_use_to_capture_your_attention\">TED Talk</a> on how the big tech companies use manipulative tricks to capture our attention and what we as individuals can do about it. You can also check out ‘Mr Binge Breaker’ on <a href=\"https://journal.thriveglobal.com/@tristanharris\">Medium</a>, on Bill Maher’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewj4ql6pu9w\">60 minutes</a> or read his <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-binge-breaker/501122/\">in-depth interview</a> with The Atlantic. Then there’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsJames_\">James Williams</a>, the other co-founder of the Time Well Spent movement and a design ethicist at Oxford University, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_kint\">Jason Kint</a>, the CEO of Digital Content Next and the witty <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackMarshall\">Jack Marshall</a>, a reporter at The Wall Street Journal, covering media and marketing. More and more people are standing up and saying that the way the web works isn’t working.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-planking.jpg\" alt=\"Planking - never again\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">With Facebook and Google’s steady year on year growth, it can seem like the only way for both giants to go is up. But remember McDonalds: what if we increasingly decide to make healthier choices? What if we stop getting our media through the duopoly? There are some signs that may <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/news/report-facebook-user-growth-could-decline-2017/\">already be starting to happen</a>. Social trends can die as swiftly as they explode onto the scene. Anyone remember using Blackberry Messenger or Planking?</p> <p>As we saw with The Correspondent, publishers are already seeing a situation where some more people actually want brainfood: content that’s sticky, not clicky. People increasingly want to spend time well, not spend more of it. In this new world, quality content and a great user experience are vital for a publisher to thrive. If it’s our shallowest self which is reflected to us every time we open Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, the best business opportunity around might be to begin to cater for our aspirational selves. We know from countless branding studies that aspirational brands can charge a premium on their products and services, so why shouldn’t that be true in the media and publishing space too. My guess is that there will be a flight to higher ground.</p> <h2>Premium works</h2> <p>Ernst-Jan Phauth, co-founder of The Correspondent wrote in <a href=\"https://medianewsletter.net/selling-ads-is-a-short-term-strategy-here-s-why-subscriptions-are-the-future-of-journalism-6721226d52ca\">one of his Medium articles</a>: \"Readers can tell whether a publication is investing in them or selling them out. When a publication invests in its readers, readers are willing to invest in it, by paying for a subscription.\"</p> <p>The shift to the subscription economy is accelerating and undeniable. Companies like Spotify and Netflix have paved the way, and now there are more and more publishers reaping the benefits of deep, long-term subscriber relationships. The flagship for this movement is without a doubt The New York Times, which had <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/new-york-times-q2-2017-earnings-2017-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\">2.3 million paid digital-only subscriptions</a> at the end of the second quarter of 2017, a spectacular 63.4 percent rise from a year earlier. CEO Mark Thompson recently referred to the world of digital advertising as a “<a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-ceo-state-digital-advertising-nightmarish-joke/\">nightmarish joke</a>”. Other companies are following where The Times leads, towards a future where the reader, not the advertiser, is the real customer.</p> <p>There’s an obvious reason why subscription models are attractive: hugely increased average revenue per user (ARPU). You pay $63 a year to become a member of The Correspondent, and the basic digital-only subscription for The New York Times is $84 a year. How do these amounts compare to other revenue models? The ARPU from the Times’ subscribers is 43x the ARPU from advertising on the Times, 7x the ARPU from all the Times’ non-subscription sources of revenue combined, and 140x higher than the ARPU of Buzzfeed. Of course, Buzzfeed has a bigger audience than the Times, and that can mitigate for the much lower ARPU, but Buzzfeed’s model isn’t replicable for quality media – the Times’ model is.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-av-rev-per-user-Monday-Note.png\" alt=\"Average revenue per user per year - Monday Note\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"70%\"></p> <p><span>High subscription ARPUs mean a viable model for a site like The Correspondent that could never be achieved through ads alone. </span>Subscription businesses are thriving – not just the New York Times and The Correspondent, but also other mainstream titles like <a href=\"https://digiday.com/uk/guardian-draws-200000-paying-members/\">The Guardian</a>, <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/times-subscription-sales-jump-200-percent-since-pivoting-hard-news/\">The Times</a>, and some <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/05/heres-how-this-norwegian-publisher-built-a-successful-digital-subscription-model-for-local-news/\">publishers overseas</a> are seeing even greater penetration.</p> <p>A loyal subscriber base also makes your site a more attractive premium advertising proposition too. It isn’t that subscription is the only game in town, but what makes subscription work is respect for the user, and successful advertising will need to follow the same route. Companies like LittleThings are leading the way.</p> <p>The willingness for people to pay for great content and experiences is growing. But you can’t start asking people to pay for an experience that doesn’t put them first. Bob Gilbreath, marketing writer and CEO of Ahalogy wrote in <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-graph/rise-of-subscriptions-and-the-fall-of-advertising-d5e4d8800a49\">his piece on the rise of subscriptions</a>: \"A funny thing happens once you completely focus your business around making paying customers happy: Your product gets better.\" As a publisher you get more out of your happy customers as well.</p> <p>High quality, differentiated content combined with transparent and empowering user experiences will shape the future of media. Are you in?</p>",

    "post_content": "<h4>How we solved the challenges of scale and catalogue updating</h4> <p>The second <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RecSys-London/\" target=\"_blank\">RecSys London meetup</a> took place at <a href=\"https://medium.com/@CriteoEng\" target=\"_blank\">Criteo Labs</a>’ office. As well as having a great roof terrace with matching view, it also made a great venue for an informal evening full of talks, Q&amp;A, networking, drinks and tasty food.&nbsp;</p> <!--more--> <p>Our Lead Data Scientist <a href=\"https://medium.com/@MNonmad\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Mahbub Gani</a> had the opportunity to speak about the challenges of scale and catalogue updating and share the new streaming architecture being implemented at Bibblio.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s a transcript of his talk, <em>Practical Streaming:</em><br><br></p> <hr> <figure class=\"blog-object blog-object-center\"><img src=\"https://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/butler-stream.png\" alt=\"Streaming architecture\"></figure> <p>“Hello, I’m Mahbub Gani. I’m the Lead Data Scientist at Bibblio and today I’d like to talk about what I call ‘practical streaming’. Before I dive into the challenges we were trying to solve, I want to start off with the following maxim about the importance of <em>balance</em>.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Miyoko Shida\" src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-miyoko-shida.jpeg\" title=\"Miyoko Shida\"> <figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><br>Miyoko Shida Rigolo at InnoTown® 2014 exhibiting balance with exquisite skill</figcaption> </figure> <p><br>“Improving your recommender system is all about balancing between your aspirations and the time-to-market.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Our initial recommender system aimed to deliver suggestions related to source documents in a “semantic” sense. After running a series of experiments, including subjective, blind evaluations by the Bibblio team, we discovered that TF-IDF outperformed other options such as <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Word2vec</em> and <em>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</em>. This was due to the data available at the time and the nature of content of Bibblio’s clients. We started delivering relevant content recommendations using TF-IDF vectorisation and nearest neighbours.</p> <p>“Having that in mind, we were presented with two challenges we tried to solve to improve our recommender system for our client base. &nbsp;</p> <p>“Firstly, the <em>scale</em> challenge. Not surprising at all. With TF-IDF vectorisation using nearest neighbours you have the quadratic complexity challenge of performing pairwise comparisons of different embeddings for the items in your content pool. This is a canonical example of the way in which algorithmic inefficiencies and complexities can influence the business greatly. We have quite a tight on-boarding pipeline for our clients, and we basically throttle that pipeline because we have to wait for a few hours for these pairwise comparisons to be completed. That’s not viable for some of our clients.<br><br></p> <figure><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-scale-challenge.jpeg\"></figure> <p><br>“This is connected to the second challenge, which we call the content update challenge. Some of our clients, for example <a href=\"http://theday.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Day</a> who provide an online news service for schools, publish new articles on a daily basis. It’s in their best interest, and therefore in our interest, that those ‘fresh’ content items are reflected in the recommendations served to their users. With our pre-streaming architecture we need to wait an hour or so, before the recommendations for the freshly ingested items are available. This is because you have to perform the pairwise comparisons which present quadratic complexity.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-update-challenge.jpeg\"> <figcaption><br>Related Articles and Related texts refined by Bibblio’s recommender system</figcaption> </figure> <p><br>“We also have other types of clients, for example the <a href=\"http://deslibris.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Electronic Library</a> (CEL), who are not ingesting books on an hourly or even daily basis. In this case, we can afford to do a full or bulk index of the entire corpus overnight or when a reasonable number of content items have been accumulated in our system. A subliminal message, by coincidence, in the recommendations for CEL here— <em>Balancing Act.</em></p> <p>“This [below] is a busy slide, deliberately so. See it as an attempt to obfuscate our secret sauce. Actually no — it’s not rocket science! I’m just going to run through the principal components of our streaming architecture.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-streaming-rescue.jpeg\"></figure> <p><br>“Streaming is coming to the rescue here. And I’d rather call it quasi-streaming. So we’re not using Spark- streaming, we’re using a conventional Spark architecture to address the streaming problem. So as before, we generate these TF-IDF embeddings, these vectors, for the new items <em>and</em> the original items. But we do have the option of persisting the original item vectors.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The problem that arises when you don’t recompute the vectors of all of your items, is twofold. First of all, the inverse document frequency of the TF-IDF is across all documents. So you need a way to recomputing those in an approximate manner with freshly ingested items. Secondly, it introduces complexity downstream because you have to do some additional computations. But relative to the quadratic complexity of the distant matrix computation of the pairwise comparison, these problems are not such an issue. We decided in our architecture to just recompute all those vectors.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Importantly, it’s possible to claw back some computational time by persisting the dictionary which you can reload as part of the TF-IDF pipeline. And because you only have a small number of new items, you need only to recompute the distances between those items and the other items of your corpus. And therefore, if the size of the corpus is <em>N</em> and the number of new items is <em>n</em>, the complexity is of order the product of <em>N</em> and <em>n</em>. And if <em>n</em> is much smaller than <em>N</em>, it’s considerably lower than quadratic complexity. So practically, our solution dramatically reduces the computational time.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/recsysldn-mahbub-wide.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Mahbub Gani\"></figure> <p><br>“The other thing I want to mention, and I’m interested to hear your thoughts: we were using column similarity computation routine out-of-the-box from Spark. And frankly, it was… rubbish. There is always a trade-off between taking something out-of-the-box and save development time or ripping it out and building it from scratch so it’s optimised to your particular circumstance. After a considerable amount of pain, we decided to just rip it out and write our own column similarity routine. Conceptually, it isn’t that difficult. It dramatically reduced the computational time. We’re talking going from a 10 hour computation to a 5 hour one or even lower. If you look at the routine, the main problem with the out-of-the-box Spark is that it implements an injudicious management of the RDDs. It’s highly asymmetric, which is a bit silly if you think about it. Our own routine balances the computations between the RDDs in a fairer and more sensible matter.</p> <p>“After that, we insert what we call inbound recommendations for that freshly ingested item against all other items into a Redis cache. This is all off-line. At presentation time the recommendations will be retrieved from Redis. &nbsp;</p> <p>“The outbound recommendations, i.e. reflecting those new items in the recommendation sets of the base corpus of original items; that requires new computation and that’s something we do as part of a bulk index. And then you have to take a hit with quadratic complexity.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-streaming-architecture.jpeg\"></figure> <p><br>“This [above] is our streaming architecture. I don’t think it will be much of a surprise now. We have fresh items coming in, which get ingested and enriched. We’ve plugged in our ingestion into <em>Watson Natural Language Understanding</em> to produce metadata. We also present it as an option for clients to open for viewing by the user. Those items are then queued in order to be indexed into Redis. We have a <em>butler handler process</em> that determines which streaming mode to activate, and this draws upon optimisation heuristics. The heuristics are based on the size of the corpus, the number of new items, the nature of the client among other things. This determines whether we should perform a bulk index, which includes an all-against-all comparison and introduces quadratic complexity, or go down the streaming route.&nbsp;</p> <p>“We can perform a full vectorisation, meaning we recompute all the TF-IDF vectors and the dictionary. Otherwise, we have the option of performing partial vectorisation. We basically still do the full vectorisation, but we load back in the dictionary that’s saved. And as I mentioned before, in both streaming cases we perform a partial distance matrix computation. We finally push all the recommendations into Redis.&nbsp;</p> <p>“An important side note here. One of the things we’re considering as part of the streaming architecture is spinning up ad hoc clusters. This is in order to perform bulk ingestion or the partial vectorisation for modest amounts of freshly ingested items. Currently, we have permanent, light weight clusters on Amazon Web Services. For our bulk ingestion we’re thinking about using the Google Cloud Platform. With a free account you can get in yourself and try to launch Spark clusters, submit jobs, run your evaluation and then tear it down. And even better, you can do all of this programmatically on a Jupyter Notebook, say.&nbsp;</p> <p>“To conclude my talk, some parting wisdom on practical streaming. First of all: know your clients. Segment, not regiment. Don’t treat them all as one. One size doesn’t fit all, definitely not in the recommender space.&nbsp;<br><br></p> <figure><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-recsysldn-parting-wisdom.jpeg\"></figure> <p><br>“Secondly, engage in what I call ‘small’ r and D and not ‘big’ R &amp; D. I was doing a lot of the <em>R </em>when I was in academia, and not much of the <em>D</em>. Almost non-existent. What I’m doing now is a bit of research, some development and then push to production. I have to tell you, from my experience, I get a massive kick out of getting through that cycle quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Thirdly, Spark is good for certain things, but not that good. You might have that experience, I’m sure I and lots of my data science friends have. I know many people are basically retreating back to just a single beefy machine. They get rid of network overhead and gain control over the integration and your process.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Finally, think about programmatic cluster creation and jobs submission and termination, which you can perform on demand.</p> <p>“I think that’s it for today. Thank you all for listening.”<br><br></p> <hr class=\"section-divider\"> <p><br>Bibblio solves the problems of audience retention and engagement by showing each user the best of your own content.</p>",

    "post_date": "01-Aug-2017 12:00:00",
    "post_content": "<p>The internet wants our attention, but what do we want from the internet?</p> <!--more--> <p>The last 10 years have brought all the world’s music, entertainment and information directly to your screen of choice. Spotify, Netflix, Facebook and YouTube are now the brand names we all recognise, but the underlying outcome is that we are rapidly approaching peak attention. I define peak attention as the moment when there’s so much competition for your attention that it reaches saturation point. When there is no more time to spare.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-attention-merchants.jpg\" alt=\"The Attention Merchants\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\" style=\"width: 320px;\" width=\"320\">Time is the ultimate finite resource and increasingly, ours is being spent online.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Attention-Merchants-Scramble-Inside-Heads/dp/0385352018\" target=\"_blank\">Attention Merchants</a>, Tim Wu’s examination of the constant commercial effort to capture and commodify our attention, we are presented with a sort of paradox: To pay attention to one thing, we need to filter other things out. That has consequences.</p> <p>Herbert Simon first coined the term Attention Economy way back in 1971. His simple conclusion was that an explosion of information must lead to a scarcity of what it consumes, our attention. From his office, it’s like he foresaw the entire rise of social media with its endless content feeds. We now spend more than 10bn hours a week on the main social platforms, and that number is still rising fast. The total attention equation is different still. Between online and offline media platforms, the average American spends one more hour per day on media than they did just 2 years ago – almost <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2016/the-total-audience-report-q1-2016.html\" target=\"_blank\">11 hours a day</a> in total.</p> <p>It is important to say at this stage that some of this time is well spent. Connecting with friends and family, catching up on the world or just watching something you are passionate about can be important and relaxing, or even inspiring. Julius Yago famously won the World Championships in Javelin after learning to throw via YouTube.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-julius-yego.jpg\" alt=\"Julius Yego\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\">However, the reality is that most of the commercial internet is driven by advertising, fuelled by content and services designed to consume our attention regardless of whether that’s a good or bad thing. The modern tech industry sells human attention as a commodity to advertisers. Together, Facebook and Google now control some 50% of the online ad market globally, a position set to earn them a combined <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/21/facebook-and-google-ad-youtube-make-advertising-in-2017.html\" target=\"_blank\">$106bn</a> in 2017.</p> <p>Like the fossil fuel companies before them, Facebook, Google and the other attention merchants must continuously unlock new pockets of human attention to keep growing their revenues. And to continue the analogy, the negative externalities of the industry don’t seem to be something these companies want to confront. Little wonder then, that many of the tactics deployed by the industry comes from the addiction playbook of casinos and other restricted product categories like cigarettes and alcohol. When you open Candy Crush, your actual battle is not with little coloured gems on the screen, it’s with the hundreds of behavioural scientists, data scientists and developers behind the screen trying to get you hooked. Opening YouTube, Instagram or Facebook is no different really – but its less obvious and more pervasive, as opting out now has significant consequences for your “real” life.</p> <p>We procrastinate, scroll, share and binge-watch largely by design – not just our own doing.</p> <p>Have you ever wondered why notifications pop up on your mobile screen or videos automatically start playing in your feed? There is an <a href=\"https://journal.thriveglobal.com/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3?gi=356917c1fb58\" target=\"_blank\">attention arms race</a> underway right beneath the sleek screen, and its forcing services to enter into a destructive competitive spiral for our continued attention, even if that increasingly means disrupting us or high-jacking our focus.</p> <p>So, where does that leave us - the users of this brave new digital world?</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-teen-phone.jpg\" alt=\"Depression and anxiety in our youth\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">It is well established that heavy usage of social media platforms or technology can be directly detrimental to our personal well-being. Everyone seems to live such rich, fulfilled and happy lives in their photos and posts.</p> <p>This constant bombardment of aspiration and expectation causes depression and anxiety in many kids, teenagers and adults - problems that are now well described in the academic literature but rarely discussed in any seriousness and depth out in society. The more we participate, build profiles and social networks, the more identity we also stand to lose if we try to walk away. The lock-in is complete.</p> <p>Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently proclaimed, jokingly, that their biggest competitor now is sleep.</p> <p>The problem can be aptly illustrated with Daniel Kahneman’s idea of the experiencing self and the remembering self. Kahneman essentially argues that we are characterised by being short term actors and long term reflectors. While our experiencing self may easily fall prey to free services and addiction tactics, our remembering self can still feel upset about having procrastinated for hours on YouTube or Instagram instead of fulfilling important obligations, achieved our goal, or simply gotten a good night’s sleep.</p> <h2>Three reasons it’s different this time</h2> <p>On the surface, one could reasonably argue that digital media is simply playing out along the same trajectory as all other mass media before in history. Haven’t newspapers, radio and TV all seen their fair share of both nutritious ingredients and junk food before the internet came about? What exactly is different this time? Could Facebook and Google not simply be the next generation of ESPN or CNN, and famous YouTubers the modern Beverly Hills 90210?</p> <p>One question is what exactly constitutes a meaningful use of one’s attention, another is this current wave of fake news and click bait is different from the other instances of “fake news” - dating all the way back to at least the great <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-great-moon-hoax\" target=\"_blank\">Moon Hoax of 1835</a>?</p> <p>In my opinion this analysis misses the mark in three important ways that means we have reached a fork in the road. We are facing a paradigm shift. As Fidel Castro once bluntly remarked; a revolution is not a trail of roses, it is a fight to the death between the future and the past.</p> <h3>1) The loss of gate keepers</h3> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-abandoned-tollgate.jpg\" alt=\"The loss of gate keepers\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">This has been said a million times before, but it must be said again. As a culture, we are still only beginning to come to terms with the consequences of obliterating the barriers to production and distribution of information. We have witnessed a true explosion in content the last 10-15 years – good and bad, but most of it instantly forgettable.</p> <p>Publishing and distribution of information was until recently a very limited resource due to the barriers of entry to the airwaves. Getting on TV or in the newsstands was either hard or very expensive. Now we are all creators, yelling into a great digital pillow hoping to get approval and recognition from a set of algorithms built in Silicon Valley. I love what has happened to the possibilities of communication between people and the unlimited creative options of expression provided by the web itself, but I despise the utter triviality of what its most prominent players feed us with daily.</p> <h3>2) The compounding competition for attention</h3> <p>Rather than simply replacing TV with social media in a zero-sum game, there is a compounding effect on competition for attention across all the media we consume. We enter a state of hyper-competition where everyone increasingly fights for the same attention, so something must lose out. TV and social media effectively competes with everything else that could command our attention - friends, hobbies or learning.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-hands-air.jpg\" alt=\"The compounding competition for attention\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\"> The Head of the Federal Communications Commission observed in a 1961 speech to broadcast executives, that the industry’s revenue was rising 9 percent annually, even in a recession. The problem, the FCC chairman told the group, was the way the business was making money: not by serving the public interest, but by airing more and more dumb shows. “When television is bad, nothing is worse,” he said. Since then the competition for attention has doubled many times, and the downsides of sensationalism has risen proportionally with it.</p> <p>We sometimes read headlines about teenagers addicted to video games in South Korea or people that have dedicated their entire life to social media and become YouTube stars or Instagram celebrities, but do we do enough to discuss the potential pitfalls for individuals, communities and society? Fake news, clickbait and filter bubbles are now regular topics of discussion in some circles, but the true structural issue is that all digital services compete for the same 24 hours, and it creates a very real and compounding competitive effect that drives product decisions towards addiction patterns and sugary content. Addiction translates to money on the web, so trust the tech industry to find ever more appealing tricks to keep you hooked.</p> <p>Like with the current obesity epidemic, we are fundamentally facing a crisis of too much, not too little.</p> <h3>3) The Feedback Loop</h3> <p>There is much talk about how AI will impact the future, but in our discussions about computers beating humans at Go and the inevitable singularity, we often forget that AI has already had a massive impact on the reality that we all face every day. Our media has been transformed forever.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-facebook-phone.jpg\" alt=\"The Feedback Loop\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-right\">I believe the advent of the data feedback loop from users, now a reality with all digital media, has started to form a non-linear curve in the performance of software with the same profound implications as Moore’s law has had for hardware. Software can now learn exponentially, powered by unprecedented computational power and vast data sets of real human behaviour. These new self-learning systems will inevitably get very good at hooking us in – and keeping us there.</p> <p>Facebook’s newsfeed has rightly been called the most disruptive invention in media in the last 50 years, and one simple reason is the data feedback loop from its users. This allowed Facebook to get ever better at locating our emotional triggers - and serve content or notifications we would find it difficult to resist engaging with. Machine learning is the ideal tool for discovering how to optimise system performance within huge sets of personal data, and now we have colossal social graphs being trained to entertain us into submission.</p> <p>Allow me to quote these two passages from Neil Postman’s introduction to “Amusing Ourselves to Death” as my point has already been said better than I ever could.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-amusing-ourselves-to-death.jpg\" alt=\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\"> “We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn't, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.</p> <p>But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.</p> <p>As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny \"failed to consider man's almost infinite appetite for distractions”.</p> <p>This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.”</p> <p>Can we continue to resist the constant temptation without succumbing to <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3009641/quick-end-decision-fatigue-before-it-drains-your-productivity-reservoir\" target=\"_blank\">decision fatigue</a> and cave in more often than not? Technological evolution has exponentially surpassed the speed of human evolution. Technological evolution has been doubling every eighteen months, now accelerated further with machine learning. We, biological entities, only progressing at the speed of biological evolution, can easily start making suboptimal choices when faced with machines that have a superior ability for pattern recognition and endless persistence.</p> <h2>Next stop - Dystopia or Utopia?</h2> <p>The trouble with the current internet, Ev Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you’re driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course, you look. Everyone looks. It is attention grabbing. The internet currently interprets behaviour like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them.</p> <p>If this whole piece comes across as slightly dystopian reading, it is not a coincidence. It is important to outline some of the fundamental challenges we face with new technology, especially technologies that are now occupying such a central role in our lives and learning so much about us. Some days, all the original operating principals of the internet seem very far from the reality we all face daily.</p> <p><img src=\"http://assets.bibblio.org/hubfs/images/blog/blog-edward-murrow.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Murrow\" class=\"blog-inline-image blog-image-left\">To quote one of the TV heavyweights, Edward Murrow, as he concluded a speech in 1958.</p> <p>“This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise, it's nothing but wires and lights in a box. There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful.”</p> <p>That battle for our attention, between triviality and continued progress, is still raging 60 years later – with ever increased intensity. But make no mistake, it is a war we ultimately can’t afford to lose. Our individual reality is the sum of the way our attention has been spent - and it is under renewed attack in recent years.</p> <p>Luckily humanity has surprised in the face of adversity many times before. New business models and products could still appear and gain widespread adoption because it better serves people. Just look at the rise of organic food and vegetarianism in the last 15-20 years.
